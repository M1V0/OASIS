m4wc3_v1,Cognitive Status Moderates Long-term Benefits of Non-pharmacological Insomnia Therapy in Older Adults,"INTRODUCTION: This secondary analysis examined whether mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
moderates the effectiveness of non-pharmacological insomnia therapy, and whether insomnia
therapy is associated with clinically meaningful symptom reduction.
METHODS: Cognitively intact (CI; n=87) and MCI (n=38) older adults with insomnia
completed insomnia therapy. The primary outcome was the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI),
assessed at baseline, post-treatment, and six-month follow-up (6FU). Linear mixed effects
models evaluated ISI changes across time and group. Logistic regression examined clinically
meaningful reductions (ISI decrease≥6).
RESULTS: Both groups showed significant ISI reductions at post-treatment and 6FU (pvalues&lt;.
0001). There were no between-group differences at post-treatment (p=.869). Yet, at
6FU, CI participants, compared to MCI, showed significantly greater symptom reduction
(p=.036), and a higher proportion achieved clinically meaningful reduction in ISI (78.7% vs
45.8%).
DISCUSSION: Older adults with MCI benefit from insomnia therapy; however, their continued
symptom reduction six-months later may be dampened compared to CI older adults.",2025-10-02T21:26:16.128537,"CBT-I,Insomnia,Mild Cognitive Impairment,Non-Pharmacological Therapy for Insomnia,Sleep",,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/m4wc3_v1/,,psyarxiv
j69f8_v1,Text-based and memory-based metrics of cognitive coupling,"The present study was an investigation of the relation between cognitive
coupling, a correlation between text di!culty and reading time, and other
measures of mind wandering during reading. To measure cognitive coupling,
we manipulated the text di!culty of individual sentences. Because mind
wandering may shift attention away from the text, we predicted cognitive
coupling, that is, that the e""ect of di!culty on processing time, should be less
when readers are o"" task. We also manipulated the consistency of a target
sentence’s content with a prior information. Analogous to the text-based
cognitive coupling, we predicted an interaction of consistency with task focus:
the impact of this consistency should be less noticeable when readers are o""
task. The results demonstrated the predicted text-based cognitive-coupling
e""ect: There was less of an e""ect of text di!culty when readers reported being
o"" task. However, there was no such interaction between consistency and task
focus. We conclude that the consistency e""ect may depend on the relatively
automatic activation of prior information, rather than requiring consciously
retrieving related information in the mindset.",2025-10-01T17:57:56.243810,"cognitive coupling,memory resonance,mind wandering,reading,standards of coherence",10.1037/cep0000349,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/j69f8_v1/,,psyarxiv
n8pmg_v2,Value through cognitive effort: Working for an environmental organization increases subsequent donations,"Cognitive effort is a characteristic but understudied feature of many pro-environmental behaviors, and traditionally, it is mostly discussed as a barrier that keeps people from behaving pro-environmentally. In contrast, contemporary frameworks of cognitive effort show that effort can also be beneficial, for example by increasing the subjective value of the outcome of an effortful action. From this new perspective, we conducted an exploratory secondary analysis of existing data from an online study (N = 1160) featuring the Work for Environmental Protection Task (WEPT), which allows participants to exert real cognitive effort in exchange for donations to a pre-selected pro-environmental organization. We found that after performing the WEPT, participants were more likely to donate additional bonus money to their assigned organization compared to an alternative organization, suggesting a higher subjective value of the former. To assess the robustness of this finding, we conducted a high-powered, preregistered confirmatory study (N = 801). We found that the differential pattern in the donation decisions replicated with a larger effect size and was also consistent with self-reported subjective value of the organizations. These findings indicate that spending effort for the benefit of a pro-environmental organization can increase the value assigned to that organization. This resonates with the idea that effort is more than just a barrier and can have a positive effect on pro-environmental behavior.",2025-10-01T08:07:44.354196,,,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/n8pmg_v2/,,psyarxiv
29dcr_v1,Revisiting Orthographic Effects in Spoken Word Recognition: Insights from Pretrained Language Models,"The paired lexical decision task is a common task used for studying online speech processing. Several key priming effects underlying the composition of the mental lexicon have been found using this priming paradigm, non-exhaustively including orthographic priming effects, semantic priming effects, and phonological priming. This study revisits the effects of orthographic priming in an auditory lexical decision task with English heteronymic pairs, word pairs that share the same orthographic form but have distinct phonological codes. Although heteronymic pairs present an ideal condition for orthographic priming effects to surface, heteronyms are often related to each other semantically, making it difficult to isolate possible orthographic effects from semantic priming effects. To this end, we present a novel methodology for using language models to generate semantically matched prime target controls to compare reaction times against. Using these semantically matched controls, we gather reaction time results from a sample of 29 English speaking university student and conduct Bayesian Regression analysis on 153 heteronymic prime target pairs and 343 control pairs. We find no significant difference in reaction times between heteronymic pairs and semantically matched pairs.",2025-10-01T08:47:26.277677,,,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/29dcr_v1/,,psyarxiv
35v9y_v1,Defining high-quality bridging elements in cognitive behavior therapy - a way to support their implementation in patient’s daily lives after psychotherapy daily lives after psychotherapy,"The post-treatment continuation of effective elements, strategies, techniques and behaviors acquired in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) represents a key element of relapse prevention. Research indicates that the quality rather than the quantity of these elements predict therapeutic outcomes in CBT. However, it remains unclear which factors facilitate the post-treatment implementation and continuation of individually helpful elements. This study investigated whether the quality of ""bridging elements"" predicts their implementation in the post-treatment phase. Bridging elements were defined as any element of previous therapy that a patient has experienced as helpful and that helps maintain treatment effects from the patient's perspective after treatment termination. Criteria were derived from the literature to rate the quality of patients' open-ended descriptions of their bridging-elements. A prospective longitudinal observational study was conducted with 120 inpatients who had been previously treated with CBT. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that a quality score composed of four quality criteria significantly predicted implementation of bridging elements even after controlling for motivational factors, while none of the single quality criteria alone was predictive at four-month follow-up. Prior to treatment termination individually helpful bridging elements should be identified to foster enduring change. Specific attention should be paid to defining high-quality bridging skills, which should be specific, time-limited, independent from others, action-oriented, measurable, and frequently applicable.",2025-09-30T21:25:01.579474,,,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/35v9y_v1/,,psyarxiv

These traits did not affect their own earnings but reduced partners’ earnings. Furthermore, lower guilt correlated with addiction severity.

arpyq_v4,Too Depleted to Learn? An Exploration of Cognitive Load and the Testing Effect,"The testing effect occurs when learners, after receiving information to learn and practicing through an assessment, show superior performance in subsequent tests compared to simply reviewing the information. This effect tends to be less pronounced or even reversed when immediate tests are employed instead of delayed tests. The objective of this study was to examine the occurrence of this effect by varying the complexity within the same specific knowledge domain. Consequently, a quantitative investigation was developed with a sample of 310 students from an elementary school in the city of Santa Isabel, Ecuador. The sample included 171 females and 139 males, with an average age between 9 and 12 years, and a factorial design was implemented with the variables of task sequence (example-example vs. example-problem), element interactivity (i.e., high vs. low), and test timing (i.e., immediate vs. delayed). The results indicated that performance in both immediate and delayed tests is superior in tasks with a low level of element interactivity compared to tasks with high element interactivity. It was also found that example-problem tasks are better than example-example tasks in the delayed test. It is concluded that the relationship between element interactivity and the testing effect is not entirely clear, and it is suggested that the design of learning tasks should impose cognitive load within the limits of working memory.",2025-09-29T15:44:48.250797,"cognitive load,element interactivity,testing effect",,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/arpyq_v4/,,psyarxiv
z4ruj_v4,Attention hijacked: How social media notifications disrupt cognitive processing,"Digital notifications are ubiquitous in modern life, yet their impact on cognitive performance remains poorly understood. Here, we introduce an ecologically valid paradigm to examine how social media notifications disrupt ongoing task performance. Participants completed a Stroop task while receiving smartphone-style notifications, allowing us to track both behavioural and physiological responses. Notifications triggered a transient slowdown in cognitive processing lasting approximately seven seconds, driven by the combined influence of perceptual salience, learned associations, and relevance appraisal. The magnitude of this disruption was predicted by the inferred relevance of notifications and by individual patterns of smartphone use—specifically, the frequency of interaction (notification volume and checking behaviour) rather than total time spent on the device. These findings were mirrored in changes in pupil dilation, a physiological marker of cognitive load, confirming the convergent impact of notification relevance and smartphone habits. Together, our results show that modern digital cues can hijack attentional resources, even in the absence of explicit personal relevance. They underscore the need to account for notification frequency—not merely screen time—when evaluating the cognitive cost of pervasive digital environments, and raise broader concerns about the long-term impact of habitual device interaction on attentional functioning.",2025-09-30T17:38:06.488600,"Attention disruption,Emotional response,Smartphone use,Social media notification,User behaviors",,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/z4ruj_v4/,,psyarxiv
8zahd_v1,"Age of parents and cognitive ability of their children –  is there a negative, no or positive correlation?","In recent decades, the average age of parents at the birth of their children has increased. Older parents have generally completed their education, are emotionally more mature and usually have work experience and their own income, which can be an advantage for their children’s development. On the other hand, the risk of mutations (in the father) increases as the parents get older, and there are also general health risks (especially in the mother). This means that both positive and negative factors for cognitive development are linked to the age of the par-ents. In our study with five diverse samples from different ethnic backgrounds, we covered an age range of 6 to 18 years (primary and secondary schools in Austria and Ecuador, N=920), used tests for both fluid and crystallized intelligence, and used target-specific measures for control variables. We calculated correlations and regressions between parental age and chil-dren’s intelligence (controlling for parental education, parental income, number of children, birth order and sex of children). Positive (linear) correlations were found in four out of five samples, on average r=+.10 to r=+.11 (N=920). Curvilinear (quadratic, inverted U-shaped) correlations are higher than linear ones (R=.20). The association with the age of the mother is somewhat stronger (father RF=.16 vs. mother RM=.19). The effect of parental age remained positive when other family variables were taken into account in a regression: beta=+.19. The par-ents’ level of education was more relevant (beta=+.28). Even if the possible effects are not large, there are predominantly positive (statistical) effects of the age of parents at the birth of their children on the development of their children. The slight inverted U-shaped curvilinearity in-dicates an optimal age for expectant parents of around 25/30 to 40 years.",2025-09-27T04:19:46.586342,,,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/8zahd_v1/,,psyarxiv
njvdg_v2,Social offloading: When joint action leads to cognitive facilitation,"Sharing a task in the real world can be more efficient than doing it alone. However, psychology experiments using shared task paradigms have often revealed a cognitive cost from working together. Research on joint action has shown how people track and prioritise the actions and intentions of task partners even when this generates cognitive interference and impairs performance. In contrast, we present four experiments using the picture–word interference (PWI) task in which joint action removed cognitive interference and facilitated performance. In the standard PWI task performed alone, participants respond to target pictures while ignoring distractor words written on top. If picture–word pairs are related (e.g., apple–orange) then responses are slowed compared to when they are unrelated (e.g., apple–book), known as semantic interference. In our joint version of the task, we removed semantic interference by telling participants they would be collaborating with a partner who was responsible for the distractor words (Experiment 1, N = 77). Furthermore, interference was only removed when participants believed that their partner was responding specifically to the words (Experiment 2, N = 78), was perceived as high in social status (Experiment 3, N = 80), or high in task competence (Experiment 4, N = 76). We propose this demonstrates how people can deprioritise information associated with partners on shared tasks. In doing so, they can reduce their own cognitive demands by leveraging the cognitive resources of others to support an efficient division-of-cognitive-labour.

a8zye_v2,From Plato to AI: Knowledge and its construction from a cognitive and a sociocultural perspective,"In this article I address different approaches to understanding processes of media-based collaborative knowledge construction. First, I describe various considerations of the nature of knowledge in the history of philosophy with a focus on the age-old epistemological controversy between rationalism and empiricism. Building on these reflections I present different psychological traditions of conceptualizing knowledge and their implications for the use of digital media. Then I introduce collective knowledge construction as a process in which people create new insights collaboratively in inter-personal activities that involve the collective creation of meaning and recollection via social interaction. I discuss conceptualizations of knowledge construction from a cognitive and from a sociocultural perspective. After that, as an integrative approach, I present a systems theoretical account that considers knowledge construction as a co-evolution of cognitive and social systems. The article concludes with a discussion of how collective knowledge construction as a cognitive and sociocultural phenomenon is currently changing due to recent developments in generative Artificial Intelligence. I argue that this has also implications for memory processes, which are not mere individual repositories but part of distributed systems of cultural memory incorporating digital artifacts and human networks.",2025-09-25T21:15:57.836598,,,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/a8zye_v2/,,psyarxiv
r97dy_v2,"Balancing Cognitive Flexibility and Stability: The Role of Reward, Autism, and Transdiagnostic Traits","The balancing of cognitive flexibility versus stability is an important everyday skill that can be learned through reinforcement and may be impaired in autism or other transdiagnostic traits. In this preregistered study (n=412), we show that rewarding people more on task switch trials led them to show more voluntary switching behaviour, but also more task-rule interference. We further show that it is difficult to unlearn this shift along the flexibility-stability trade-off, even when the mapping between task switching and reward reversed. People with more autism traits or an autism diagnosis were equally fast at learning these contingencies but seemed to start from an overall smaller task-rule interference effect and larger switch costs – suggesting they show higher levels of cognitive stability at the cost of less flexibility. These patterns seemed unique to autism, as we failed to observe similar effects in four major transdiagnostic traits extracted from a principal component analysis based on 15 clinical questionnaires.",2025-09-25T14:21:07.271854,,,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/r97dy_v2/,,psyarxiv
r2ybv_v1,Assessing text experience in British primary school children: New validated title and author recognition tests,"Becoming a skilled reader requires that children accumulate extensive experience with text through independent reading. Research shows that greater text experience is associated with stronger reading skills, better comprehension, and improved spelling, and, consequently, higher reading motivation. Reliable objective measures of children’s reading experience are therefore essential; however, because such measures are typically highly sensitive to temporal and cultural contexts, none of the existing tests are suitable for capturing the reading experience of British children today. We address this gap by introducing a new Author Recognition Test (ART) and Title Recognition Test (TRT) designed specifically for primary school children in the United Kingdom and validated with a large cohort of British pupils. The battery also includes a new multiple-choice spelling test that can be easily administered online. We further demonstrate that single-word reading and sentence reading efficiency tests from the Rapid Online Assessment of Reading (ROAR) can be adapted for use with British children and provide valid measures of reading proficiency. Together, these tools offer a much-needed, freely available resource for both researchers and practitioners, enabling reliable measurement of children’s text experience and basic literacy skills.

zj7tu_v5,Understanding family dynamics through a neurocognitive lens,"Individual family members impact each other and the family system at the physiological, brain, behavioral, phenomenological, and social level. Previous research used established methods, such as self-report and behavioral observation, to provide thorough insights into family dynamics. Here, we aim to complement existing methods and argue for a neurocognitive approach in family research. Neurocognitive tools can provide detailed and nuanced insights into complex family dynamics by capturing behavioral and brain processes at the individual and family level. By measuring neural activity and the alignment of brain activity between family members we can uncover complex recurrent and situation-dependent interactions that so far have remained hidden. Using this approach, we can increase the scope of family research, especially when measuring family members across generations with different levels of verbal ability. It allows to study emotionally interconnected family members across multiple generations. Measuring behavior and brain activity of multiple family members simultaneously is therefore a promising method to reveal additional factors contributing to family well-being and inform theory and practice. As mobile neuroimaging advances, studying family interactions in natural settings, such as the family home, becomes more feasible. This opens new possibilities for family research while simultaneously increasing ecological validity. The neurocognitive approach allows us to understand known and unknown factors contributing to family dynamics and brings a mechanistic understanding closer to “home”.",2025-09-25T09:28:15.642586,"family dynamics,family psychology,hyperscanning,neurocognition",,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/zj7tu_v5/,,psyarxiv

n9ag2_v1,Effects of Musical Training on Cognitive Outcomes and White Matter Microstructure in Middle Childhood,"Musical training is associated with improved cognitive and academic performance across development. While specific neural mechanisms have been implicated in these associations, the precise relationship between white matter structure and putative cognitive effects of musical training are unclear. The present study examined the effects of musical training on cognitive performance and white matter structure in middle childhood using a combination of behavioral assessments and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in a sample of 175 preadolescents (38 musicians and 137 non-musicians) between 7-9 years old.  Cognitive abilities were tested using the Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities (WJ III) and the Operation Span Task (OSPAN), while academic achievement was assessed using the Kaufman Test of Educational Achievement (KTEA II). In addition, cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed by measuring maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max). Behavioral results revealed that participants with musical training had higher cognitive scores (F(15, 155) = 3.01, p &lt; 0.001), greater academic achievement (F(14, 156) = 3.57, p &lt; 0.001), and higher relative VO2 max (F(1, 170) = 6.32, p = 0.01) compared to non-musicians. DTI results revealed that musical training was associated with higher fractional anisotropy (F(1, 81) = 4.95, p = 0.029) and higher mode (F(1, 81) = 4.00, p = 0.049) in the left PCG to MTGp tract of the arcuate fasciculus (AF).

wbvtp_v3,The Developmental Trajectories of Implicit and Explicit Metacognitive Monitoring and Control in Cued Recall,"Adults are adept at metacognitively monitoring their memory accuracy explicitly and implicitly, and at using metacognitive control to maintain high memory accuracy, but the development of monitoring and control is less understood. We administered an episodic cued recall task with children aged five to 11 years (N = 106). Participants watched two video clips of everyday episodic events before answering cued recall memory questions. For each memory question, participants provided a confidence rating (explicit monitoring), sorted their answer into show/hide boxes (control), and chose to volunteer/withhold their response (control). Multiple behavioural gestures of cognitive effort (implicit monitoring; e.g., looking to carer, non-word fillers) were recorded and later coded by blind raters. Children were less accurate and less able to assign confidence to reflect their memory accuracy when they were forced to generate a response after previously saying “I don’t know”. But on volunteered trials, explicit, implicit monitoring and control measures predicted memory accuracy. There were age-related improvements in explicit monitoring for predicting memory accuracy, but there were no age differences in implicit monitoring or control processes. We found evidence for a direct and an indirect link between confidence and memory accuracy. Our findings suggest that explicit and implicit monitoring have different developmental trajectories in cued recall and that children can be adaptive to control their memory accuracy to a similar extent from early- to mid-childhood.",2025-09-22T22:50:23.985396,"children,confidence,cued recall,episodic memory,gestures,metacognition",10.1016/j.jecp.2025.106367,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/wbvtp_v3/,,psyarxiv

8ynvb_v1,Cognitive and neural mechanisms of risky intertemporal choices in soccer tactical contexts,"Investigating how athletes navigate these decisions in tactical contexts can provide critical insights into their behavioral preferences and strategic tendencies under conditions of temporal delay and risk. To this end, the present study designed a risky intertemporal choice task simulating a pre-match tactical scenario, and introduced a monetary condition as a control, aiming to uncover the domain-specific temporal preferences of soccer players and the underlying computational mechanisms. In Experiment 1a and Experiment 1b (n = 95), participants completed a two-alternative risky intertemporal choices task. In both experiments, the proportion of choosing the “larger-later” (LL) option was below the chance level. However, participants made more LL choices and responded more slowly in the soccer tactical context compared to the monetary context, with no significant performance differences between participant types. Experiment 2 (n = 33) further validated the behavioral findings and revealed significantly higher exponential discount rates and starting point biases in the soccer tactical context compared to the monetary context. Additionally, stronger functional connectivity between the right postcentral gyrus and mid-cingulate cortex was observed during soccer tactical decision-making, and it is significantly positively correlated with the exponential discount rate. This study found that although soccer players exhibit delay discounting in tactical choices, they demonstrate a greater degree of rationality. This rationality may be related to how a higher discount rate induces starting point biases, affecting the accumulation of decision evidence. The underlying neural basis may involve integrative processing within the postcentral gyrus-cingulate circuit.",2025-09-25T14:48:17.052929,,,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/8ynvb_v1/,,psyarxiv
q82ws_v1,Internet-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to reduce depression in China: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"1.	Background.
Internet-based cognitive behavioral treatments (iCBTs) have been used to reduce the symptoms of depression, but evidence from China is limited and not systematically integrated. Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to integrate evidence examining the effectiveness of iCBT programs to reduce depressive symptoms in the Chinese population. 

2.	Methods.
A systematic literature search was conducted across multiple databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English and Chinese including PsycINFO, Web of Science, PubMed, CNKI, and Wanfang, focusing on RCTs. The present review only included studies utilizing iCBT programs to reduce depressive symptoms on the Chinese population. Data were extracted independently by two reviewers (ZW and SW), and the risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool. Effect sizes (Cohen’s d) were pooled for individual outcomes using random-effects meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses, including one examining the impact of human provider involvement, were conducted to determine the overall effect size and explore potential moderators.

3.	Results
Eight randomized controlled trials were deemed eligible (N = 966). Results suggested that iCBT programs had a significant and sizeable effectiveness to reduce depression (d = -0.73, CI [-1.12, -0.34]). Furthermore, subgroup analyses indicated that the effectiveness of iCBT did not significantly differ between human-involved and non-human-delivered interventions. 
4.	Conclusion
iCBT programs illustrate effectiveness in alleviating depressive symptoms in the context of Chinese population, despite the high heterogeneity between studies. Future studies are warranted to further validate this effectiveness with a scale-up approach.",2025-09-22T23:10:41.476857,,,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/q82ws_v1/,,psyarxiv
ah6e8_v1,Understanding Dropout from Group Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Anxiety and Related Disorders: A Mixed Methods Investigation,"Rationale: Group Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a resource-efficient treatment that increases access to psychotherapy. Yet approximately 25% of patients drop out prematurely, reducing its effectiveness and public health impact. Despite this, few studies have contacted patients post-dropout to survey their reasons for dropout. Understanding the patient perspective is critical to identify barriers and inform strategies to improve treatment retention.
 
Objective: This study investigated reasons for dropout from group CBT for anxiety and related disorders, quantitatively contrasting individual- versus treatment-related factors and qualitatively identifying themes in patients’ own words.
 
Methods: Adult outpatients (N = 84) who discontinued a 12-session group CBT program at a tertiary-care clinic completed the Reasons for Leaving Treatment Questionnaire (RLTQ) and provided optional qualitative feedback. A mixed-methods approach was employed: a paired-samples t test examined quantitative differences between individual-level and treatment-related factors, and qualitative responses (N = 36) underwent inductive thematic analysis.
 
Results: On average, participants discontinued group CBT at session 5. Individual-level factors were more significantly endorsed than treatment-related factors as reasons for dropout. Qualitative analyses identified eight themes, with four major themes: (1) lack of relevance to specific issues/needs, (2) discomfort with group format and/or dynamics, (3) issues with facilitators and/or treatment organization, and (4) issues with CBT content, pace, structure, and/or length.
 
Conclusion: Findings indicate that dropout is influenced not only by individual-level factors but also by modifiable treatment-related factors, pointing to actionable dropout-prevention strategies—including personalization, cohesion-building, shorter waitlists, and re-engagement after missed sessions.",2025-09-21T20:03:47.030220,"anxiety and related disorders,anxiety disorders,CBT,dropout,group CBT,group cognitive behavioral therapy,mixed methods,psychotherapy,qualitative methods",,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/ah6e8_v1/,,psyarxiv
gs6he_v1,The role of inhibitory control in creative cognition: exploring a multifaceted relationship,"Creative cognition is often argued to involve a degree of inhibitory control, but it remains unclear what amount, and type, of inhibitory control is relevant to which type of creative cognition. Some evidence suggests that creative performance benefits from stronger inhibition (particularly in laboratory settings), while other evidence suggests that it benefits from weaker inhibition. Supposing that this variation in findings might be due to the multifaceted nature of both inhibitory control and creative cognition, we sought to clarify the relationship between these constructs using several measures of each, using factor analysis and regressions. We examined creative cognition using two measures of divergent thinking (the alternative uses task and a figural completion drawing task), and a measure of convergent thinking (the remote associates test). We examined inhibitory control using two measures of response inhibition (the Stroop and the Emotional Stroop), a measure of cognitive inhibition (retrieval-induced forgetting), and a measure of latent inhibition. Participants (N = 151) also completed measures of personality, intelligence, self-monitoring, and real-world creative achievement. Results revealed that cognitive inhibition was a significant predictor of divergent thinking after accounting for both trait openness and fluid intelligence, but was unrelated to convergent thinking or real-world creative achievement. Meanwhile, response inhibition and latent inhibition were not significantly related to any measure of creative cognition. These findings shed light on the nuanced relationship between inhibitory control and creative cognition, and highlight the importance of assessing these multifaceted constructs with a variety of measures.",2025-09-21T17:35:35.365914,"cognitive control,cognitive inhibition,convergent thinking,creativity,divergent thinking,drawing,hierarchical regression,inhibition,latent inhibition,multi-method,response inhibition",,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/gs6he_v1/,,psyarxiv
65xzp_v1,Emotion Recognition Training Across Sensory Modalities: Comparing the Effects of Multisensory and Unisensory Training,"Emotion-recognition training is widely used as a tool to improve emotion recognition and by extension social competence, yet few studies compare unisensory and multisensory trainings. We randomly assigned adults to auditory, visual, audiovisual, or control training groups using a validated protocol adapted across modalities, and assessed emotion recognition using auditory, visual, and audiovisual tests. Responses were scored with a similarity-based metric, and change was indexed with a normalized gain difference score. Primary analyses tested training-group effects on overall and modality-specific difference scores and evaluated cross-modal generalization (improvement on untrained modalities) and trained-modality advantage (improvement on the trained modality relative to the other two). All trained groups showed reliable pre- to post-test improvement across modalities. Between-group comparisons indicated that the auditory group outperformed control on the overall measure, and the audiovisual group outperformed control on the audiovisual task. Cross-modal generalization was evident in every trained group and absent in control, indicating transfer beyond the trained modality. Trained-modality advantage was not detected, suggesting more generalized training benefits. An exploratory comparison of basic and social emotions revealed a main effect of emotion type, without differences by training condition. Taken together, the results indicate that brief training strengthens perceptual cue use and cue integration, yielding gains within and across modalities. Practically, training programs that include audiovisual components may maximize benefits while also supporting generalization beyond the trained setting.",2025-09-21T15:11:33.356607,Emotion recognition; emotion recognition training; multisensory integration; unisensory; cross-modal generalization,,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/65xzp_v1/,,psyarxiv
m2jdy_v1,"Testing the relationships between facial emotion recognition, levels of autistic traits, and eye gaze patterns","Individuals with high levels of Autistic traits often experience challenges in interpreting others' emotions, potentially stemming from atypical patterns of visual attention to facial cues. This study investigates whether Autism-like traits in a non-clinical sample are associated with overall emotion recognition accuracy, differential attention to facial areas of interest (eyes, mouth, and other regions), and emotion-specific recognition impairments. Eighty-two participants were presented with videos of actors displaying the six basic emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise) at high and low intensities while eye movements were recorded. Autism-like traits were quantified using a composite score derived from well-validated questionnaires. Overall, higher Autism-like traits correlated with weaker emotion recognition performance (r = -.34, p = .002). Attention to the mouth was positively correlated with emotion recognition accuracy (r = .24, p = .03), but not to the eyes. Notably, levels of Autistic traits did not correlate with gaze patterns to either mouth or eye regions, a null finding that differs from established literature on eye avoidance patterns in Autistic populations. Levels of Autistic traits were selectively associated with recognition of negative emotions of anger, disgust, and fear, but not happiness. These findings confirm the relationship between Autistic traits and emotion recognition difficulties in the broader population, as well as the importance of attention to emotionally salient facial features in emotion recognition. However, our hypothesis that eye-gaze patterns would mediate the relationship between autistic traits and emotion recognition difficulties was not supported.",2025-09-21T09:12:56.428630,,,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/m2jdy_v1/,,psyarxiv

In GRIS experiments, participants manipulate a set of objects (text, audio, images) and place them on canvases.

gjt52_v2,Mid-Frontal Theta Power Associated With Instruction-Based Modulations in Cognitive Stability and Flexibility,"Cognitive stability and flexibility are often conceived as two antagonistic modes of cognitive control. While stability supports the maintenance of a stable task focus and resistance against interference, cognitive flexibility facilitates adaptive responses to changing demands. In a pre-registered electroencephalography study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying adjustments in cognitive stability and flexibility by examining neural signatures of cognitive control adjustments. Specifically, we tested whether deliberate enhancements in cognitive stability and flexibility levels were associated with a facilitation of goal shielding and shifting, respectively. Participants completed a task-switching experiment in which they received explicit strategy instructions that aimed at promoting either cognitive stability or flexibility in a within-subjects design. We assessed mid-frontal theta power as an indicator of cognitive control recruitment and effort mobilization. Participants succeeded in adopting the instructed control states and behaviorally exhibited inverse adjustments in indicators of cognitive stability and flexibility. However, we did not find any differences in theta power in response to shielding or shifting demands between conditions. Consistent with previous studies and subjective effort ratings, more stable control states were further not associated with a generally increased recruitment of cognitive control. We thus did not find that adjustments in cognitive stability and flexibility were linked to modulations in effort or cognitive control recruitment. Potential processes that may have promoted more effective task shielding and shifting are discussed, providing directions for future research.",2025-09-19T19:03:49.636115,"cognitive control,meta-control,mid-frontal theta,task switching",,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/gjt52_v2/,,psyarxiv
w7j5t_v1,Moderation is best: Examination of the effects of videogaming skills and frequency on everyday cognition across adulthood.,"Digital games can shape everyday cognition, yet the roles of player skill, videogame genre, and play frequency across adulthood remain unclear. We studied 507 adult gamers of 3 age-groups (18–35, 36–55, 56+ years) to test how gaming skill and frequency relate to everyday memory and executive functioning. Participants completed the Gaming Skills Questionnaire (GSQ) and measures of everyday cognition: the Executive Skills Questionnaire–Revised, Everyday Memory Questionnaire–Revised, and Prospective and Retrospective Memory Questionnaire. Confirmatory factor analyses supported the GSQ’s validity and reliability. Mixed-effects models estimated main and interaction effects of skill, frequency, age, and videogame genre. Higher skill was linked to fewer difficulties—especially for strategy and role-playing games—with advantages in planning, emotion regulation, and prospective/retrospective memory. In contrast, higher frequency was linked to more difficulties, particularly among younger adults. Puzzle play showed mixed associations: better organisation/time management but greater behavioural-regulation challenges. Age moderated several effects, with benefits attenuating from young to middle-aged and older groups. Findings specify conditions for genre-specific links with everyday memory and executive control: skill appears beneficial, whereas excessive frequency may undermine control processes. The GSQ offers a genre-sensitive measure for profiling gaming skill and frequency and can support research and practice on everyday memory across the lifespan.",2025-09-20T13:04:28.422636,,,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/w7j5t_v1/,,psyarxiv
n8pmg_v1,Value through cognitive effort: Working for an environmental organization increases subsequent donations,"Cognitive effort is a characteristic but understudied feature of many pro-environmental behaviors, and traditionally, it is mostly discussed as a barrier that keeps people from behaving pro-environmentally. In contrast, contemporary frameworks of cognitive effort show that effort can also be beneficial, for example by increasing the subjective value of the outcome of an effortful action. From this new perspective, we conducted an exploratory secondary analysis of existing data from an online study (N = 1160) featuring the Work for Environmental Protection Task (WEPT), which allows participants to exert real cognitive effort in exchange for donations to a pre-selected pro-environmental organization. We found that after performing the WEPT, participants were more likely to donate additional bonus money to their assigned organization compared to an alternative organization, suggesting a higher subjective value of the former. To assess the robustness of this finding, we conducted a high-powered, preregistered confirmatory study (N = 801). We found that the differential pattern in the donation decisions replicated with a larger effect size and was also consistent with self-reported subjective value of the organizations. These findings indicate that spending effort for the benefit of a pro-environmental organization can increase the value assigned to that organization. This resonates with the idea that effort is more than just a barrier and can have a positive effect on pro-environmental behavior.",2025-09-19T14:08:46.378458,,,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/n8pmg_v1/,,psyarxiv
6mrux_v2,A global matching model of choice and response times in the Deese-Roediger-McDermott semantic and structural false recognition paradigms,"One of the most common method of eliciting false memories in the laboratory is the Deese-Roediger-McDermott paradigm (Deese, 1959; Roediger \&amp; McDermott, 1995), where participants study a set of items that are all similar to a non-presented critical lure. A common finding is that false recognition to critical lures is much higher than to other non-presented items and in some cases is even comparable to true recognition, regardless of whether similarity is semantic or structural (e.g., phonological or orthographic) relations. While there exists a handful of computational models of this paradigm, they have only been applied to semantic but not structural false recognition, they have not been fit at the level of individual participants, and they have not been applied to response times (RTs). We present a global matching model that addresses all three of these current gaps. Global similarity of semantic and structural representations drives a pair of linear ballistic accumulators, which are used to produce decisions as well as complete RT distributions. In addition to being able to account for heightened false recognition of critical lures, the model was able to account for differences across both individual participants and items, lower correlations between semantic and structural false recognition than true recognition, differences in false recognition across levels of processing, improved true recognition but not false recognition with higher study time, and heightened false recognition under speed emphasis. The model suggests that semantic and structural false recognition can be explained using only a single retrieval mechanism.",2025-09-19T18:18:51.973347,"Deese-Roediger-McDermott paradigm,false memory,false recognition,global matching models,recognition memory,response times",,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/6mrux_v2/,,psyarxiv
ebh7q_v1,Word recognition in pre-foreign language learners: The role of form overlap,"This study tests how form overlap with the L1 influences young learners’ ability to recognize L2 words from continuous speech before they receive classroom instruction in English as a foreign language (EFL). German 6- to 9-year-olds were tested on their ability to recognize words in English utterances that overlapped in form with their L1 translation equivalents (e.g. cognate words, milk-Milch /mɪlk/ - /mɪlx/) or did not (e.g. noncognate words, smoke - Rauch, /smoʊk/ - /raʊ̯x/). L1 form similarity neither influenced performance at the group level nor when differences in individual L1 skills were considered. This pattern of results remained even when, in Experiment 2, the L1 word form was pre-activated visually. Unlike adults’, pre-EFL learners’ recognition of words in continuous speech does not seem to be affected by form similarity to the L1, which we link to differences in how form-meaning mappings are relevant in FL learning across development.",2025-09-18T15:06:46.818158,,,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/ebh7q_v1/,,psyarxiv
pmnz6_v1,Cognitive Restraint versus Restriction:  An Investigation of Daily Eating Patterns Among Women with Restrictive Eating Disorders,"Research has found only small-to-moderate correlations between cognitive restraint (efforts to reduce food intake) and dietary restriction (actual reduction in food intake). How scores on retrospective self-report measures of cognitive restraint and restriction relate to restrictive eating in daily life among women with eating disorders characterized by restrictive eating is unknown. In the current study, the Eating Pathology Symptoms Inventory Cognitive Restraint (EPSI-CR) and Restriction (EPSI-R) subscale scores were: 1) compared across women with anorexia nervosa (AN; n = 58), bulimia nervosa (BN; n = 56), avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID; n = 31), and non-eating disorder controls (NED; n = 53), and 2) correlated with frequency of daily restrictive eating reported via two-weeks of ecological momentary assessment. EPSI-CR scores were significantly higher in the AN group than all other groups, and people with BN scored significantly higher than ARFID and NED groups, whose scores did not significantly differ. EPSI-R scores did not significantly vary between AN and ARFID, and these groups both scored higher than BN, who scored higher than NEDs. EPSI-CR scores were not significantly correlated with frequency of restrictive eating in daily life in any diagnostic group, suggesting that past-month cognitive restraint was not associated with dietary restriction in daily life. EPSI-R scores were strongly correlated with frequency of dietary restriction in women with BN and ARFID, but not women with AN, demonstrating a discrepancy between EMA and retrospective responses. Overall, results highlight the importance of differentiating cognitive restraint and restriction when assessing and treating eating disorders.",2025-09-18T10:15:04.701668,"anorexia nervosa,avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder,bulimia nervosa,cognitive restraint,dietary restriction,eating disorders,ecological momentary assessment",,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/pmnz6_v1/,,psyarxiv
hjdpr_v2,Tap Harder: Cognitive Inhibition and Induced Emotions Predict Tapping Force in Young and Older Adults.,"Research on sensorimotor synchronization typically examines finger tapping to auditory rhythms. These studies generally investigate timing accuracy, largely neglecting the force of tapping, which provides information on exertion and thus is relevant to clinical applications of cued movement. In two experiments with healthy young and older adults, we examined the possible influence of i) cognitive function, ii) subjective factors, and iii) properties of music on the force of music-cued finger tapping, alongside possible aging effects. We found that better cognitive switching/inhibition ability inversely predicted tapping force, whereas more positively rated emotions induced by the music predicted greater tapping force. Despite known declines of motor and cognitive functions in aging, we found that age group was not a predictive factor of force, suggesting that age does not affect spontaneous force in finger tapping. We examined other relevant factors based on previous findings, including working memory, familiarity with the music, and whether the music was activating, but these also did not predict applied force. These findings demonstrate differential effects of cognitive differences and auditory cue aspects on motor control in finger tapping settings, with practical implications for improving training or rehabilitation that includes music-based movement.",2025-09-17T18:01:02.607848,,,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/hjdpr_v2/,,psyarxiv
rnuec_v3,Deciding to simulate: Cognitive mechanisms of predicting the decisions of others,"People often rely on simulating the other person’s state of mind when trying to understand and predict their behaviour. Likewise, converging evidence suggests similar cognitive and neural processes are engaged when making decisions for ourselves and when predicting the decisions of others, pointing towards mental simulation as the underlying mechanism of prediction. In this study, we tested this hypothesis directly, leveraging the fact that, under the simulation hypothesis, any predictions made with a biased decision-making process should also be biased. We first induced a bias in participant’s risk perception by adapting them to contexts with high or low risks, and then asked them to predict decisions of a risk-seeking and risk-averse agent in a mediumrisk context. Our findings provide partial support for the simulation hypothesis; the adaptation manipulation resulted in biased predicted decisions, suggesting that these predictions were made with participants’ own (biased) decision-making system. Surprisingly, this behavioural effect only emerged during predictions for a risk-averse, but not risk-seeking agent. Modeling predictions with the drift-diffusion model suggested that the prediction bias mapped onto a group difference in the risk tendency parameter when predicting for the risk-averse, but not risk-seeking agent. Furthermore, participants’ risk tendency when deciding for themselves correlated with predicted behaviour of the risk-averse, but not risk-seeking agent, suggesting the perceived similarity of the other agent as a mediating factor. Altogether, our findings support the view that people engage in simulating others’ decisions with their own mind, but also suggest that the perceived similarity with the other person may determine their prediction strategy.",2025-09-17T12:45:49.085268,"decision-making,prediction,risky choice,simulation theory,Theory of mind",,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/rnuec_v3/,,psyarxiv
eyr4a_v1,Desire Thinking as a Cognitive Mechanism of Yearning after Bereavement,"Yearning is hallmark of grief and prolonged grief, but its psychological underpinnings are poorly understood. We aimed to address this by building on the phenomenological similarities with craving and investigating the role of desire thinking, a voluntary cognitive process central to activating craving. A community sample of bereaved adults (N = 676) completed the Oxford Grief Desire Thinking Scale (OG-DT). Psychometric validity of the two-factor solution (imaginal reunion, elaborative efforts) was excellent. Another three-wave longitudinal sample (N = 275) completed the OG-DT and measures of yearning and proximity-seeking at 0–6 months after loss as well as 6 and 12 months later. Yearning mediated the relationship between both imaginal reunion and elaborative efforts and proximity-seeking behaviors. These findings suggest that desire thinking may be a cognitive driver of yearning, which in turn motivates efforts to cope with the desire. Thus, desire thinking could present a new modifiable target for intervention.",2025-09-16T19:30:19.555292,,,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/eyr4a_v1/,,psyarxiv

jyq9w_v1,Regulating intense fear: Does cognitive reappraisal attenuate physiological and behavioral fear responses in an immersive VR environment?,"Emotional experience and the regulation thereof are typically studied using picture inventories or short films to induce and modify affective states. These approaches, however, lack ecological validity due to their passive and receptive nature. Recent innovations in virtual reality and mobile neurophysiological technologies have enabled researchers to study the behavioral and neural correlates of more ecologically valid emotional responses. In this preregistered study, 58 healthy participants were randomly assigned to either use cognitive reappraisal (intervention) or to immerse themselves in their senses and surroundings (control) while walking across a wooden plank suspended 80 stories above the ground in virtual reality. We measured behavioral ratings, salivary alpha amylase and cortisol levels, as well as frontal brain asymmetries, captured using mobile electroencephalography (EEG). Across both conditions, we found decisive evidence of increased subjective fear and salivary alpha amylase, a marker of sympathetic activation. However, we found no increase in cortisol levels following the task suggesting that subjective fear alone is not sufficient to trigger an HPA-axis response. In contrast to our hypotheses, the reappraisal group did not show any difference compared to the control group for neither behavioral, endocrine nor neural measures. On the one hand, our findings may suggest that reappraisal might not be a suitable strategy to regulate realistic and intensely frightening situations. On the other hand, further analyses also indicated that the control group may have also regulated their emotions due to increased mindfulness of their inner states and their environment. Future studies are needed to confirm these observations and ascertain the efficacy of cognitive reappraisal on fear in realistic settings.",2025-09-16T19:32:52.602311,,,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/jyq9w_v1/,,psyarxiv

Here, we directly compare different variants of social reinforcement-learning and drift-diffusion models within the same collective foraging paradigm, investigating the cognitive processes
governing the integration of social information. We designed an interactive immersive-reality experiment, where participants—either alone or in groups of five—foraged for rewards in environments with different resource distributions. Our behavioral results revealed that groups outperformed solitary foragers and even optimal Bayesian agents in environments with sparse rewards but large differences in patch quality—precisely as predicted by our numerical simulations from both frameworks. Computational analyses showed that reinforcement-learning and drift-diffusion models generated similar behav-
ioral predictions, with both frameworks accurately reproducing participants’ behavior across conditions. However, at the cognitive level, both frameworks partly diverged in explaining the process of social information integration, overall suggesting that participants integrated the choices and payoffs of others into their personal evaluation of the environment. This study deepens our understanding of social decision-making processes in naturalistic collectives and emphasizes the importance of cross-framework comparisons.",2025-09-16T07:15:16.385535,"Collective Intelligence,Computational Modelling,Drift-diffusion models,Foraging,Reinforcement-learning models",,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/a3ptk_v1/,,psyarxiv

Identifying factors that reliably modulate stability and flexibility is essential for studying their underlying mechanisms and holds potential to support individuals in reducing associated costs. The present study investigated two potential control modulators and tested whether reinforcement-based learning and explicit instructions can induce shifts in cognitive stability and flexibility. Furthermore, it aimed to contribute to the ongoing debate on whether cognitive stability and flexibility represent extreme points on a unidimensional continuum and therefore underlie an inherent tradeoff or rather depend on independent mechanisms. To this end, we conducted two online task-switching experiments. In Experiment 1, we examined whether selectively rewarding participants for stable or flexible behavior would promote the respective control states. In Experiment 2, we aimed to replicate previous findings of instruction-based control adaptations. We did not find coherent evidence for reinforcement- and instruction-based control adjustments. However, across both experiments, shifts in cognitive stability and flexibility were negatively correlated at the level of individual participants.

trj6k_v1,Balancing Act: Investigating Modulators and Mechanisms of Cognitive Stability and Flexibility,"Every day, we face the opposing requirements to flexibly shift between goals and to shield them against distractions. Context-dependent adjustments of cognitive stability and flexibility are a prerequisite for adaptive behavior. A current debate centers on whether these two functions of cognitive control involve a tradeoff, manifesting in reciprocal performance benefits and costs, or if cognitive stability and flexibility can be regulated independently. This study aimed to test the assumption of a stability-flexibility tradeoff and investigate determinants of control regulations. We examined whether cognitive stability and flexibility can be regulated voluntarily and whether these adjustments are modulated by the task relevance of distracting information. In two task-switching paradigms with varying distractor relevance, we instructed participants to either focus on the current task or to switch flexibly between tasks in within-subject designs. Monetary rewards were contingent on how well participants succeeded in implementing these instructions. Across both experiments, participants adjusted their cognitive flexibility but not stability according to the instructions. The distractor relevance further did not moderate control adjustments. Multilevel analyses revealed no correlations between changes in task-switch costs and interference costs in both experiments, providing no evidence for the expected tradeoff between cognitive stability and flexibility. Our results provide evidence that adjustments in cognitive flexibility are partly under voluntary control. However, they do not support the notion of an inherent stability-flexibility tradeoff, at least in the task-switching paradigms we used.",2025-09-16T07:00:08.860658,"cognitive control,control dilemma,meta-control,shielding-shifting dilemma,task-switching",,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/trj6k_v1/,,psyarxiv

zyb3f_v2,A Cross-Sectional Study on the Usefulness of Posted Results Data from Trial Registries for Meta-Analyses on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy,"Introduction: Posting results to clinical trial registers is encouraged and even mandatory for certain trials. This study assessed the feasibility of using structured results data from ClinicalTrials.gov for meta-analyses on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) using two exemplary approaches. 

Methods: In study one, we searched ClinicalTrials.gov for studies employing CBT for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and extracted posted results. We evaluated whether the data were sufficient for running a meta-analysis. In study two, we selected a published meta-analysis on digital interventions for depression, extracted all registrations of the primary sources, and assessed if the meta-analysis could be reproduced using posted results.

Results: For study one, we identified 179 completed studies on CBT for MDD from ClinicalTrials.gov. 16 of 179 studies had posted results and 15 had reported depression outcomes, using various psychological scales, such as the BDI-II. This low number of posted results and the heterogeneity of reported scales made running a meta-analysis infeasible. In study two, using 83 primary sources of a published meta-analysis, we obtained 59 registrations. Only three studies had  posted results, all to ClinicalTrials.gov. Again, this made running or reproducing the meta-analysis infeasible.

Conclusion: The potential for clinical trial registries to support meta-analyses is substantial, yet few studies on psychotherapy post their results. Core results of clinical trials should be openly available in a timely manner and in a structured format. Currently, it seems that the posting of results data is so uncommon that running meta-analyses using structured results data from trial registries is practically impossible.",2025-09-15T13:42:40.055863,"cognitive behavioral therapy,depression,feasibility,meta-science,trial registration",,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/zyb3f_v2/,,psyarxiv

Given the importance of sustaining adequate levels of cognitive performance for professional and personal activities, this potential side effect warrants careful examination. Here, we synthesize evidence from experimental studies comparing cognitive performance between fasted and satiated healthy adults using standardized psychological tasks. Analyzing 222 effect sizes across 3,484 participants (median fasting duration: 12 hours), our hierarchical random-effects model revealed no meaningful difference between fasted and satiated participants (g = 0.02, 95% CrI = [-0.05, 0.10]), with low between-study heterogeneity (τ = 0.17). Notably, we observed modest reductions in cognitive performance for longer fasting intervals, and for younger (vs. older) participants during fasts. Differences across cognitive domains (e.g., attention and inhibitory control) were negligible. These findings suggest that cognitive performance remains remarkably stable during short-term fasting, supporting the feasibility of fasting practices while highlighting nuanced considerations for implementation in health interventions.",2025-09-15T13:41:44.865510,"Bayes,cognition,fastng,intermittent-fasting,meta-analysis",10.1037/bul0000492,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/tgwep_v1/,,psyarxiv
wyvq9_v1,Methodology for Structural Equation Model Selection: A Foundation for Holistic Understanding of Cognitive Biases in the Workplace,"This paper outlines the methodological approach to Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) model selection employed in a quantitative study investigating cognitive biases in workplace decision-making in Singapore. Building upon a comprehensive systematic literature review (Ohms 2025g), which identified key research gaps and prominent cognitive biases, and a subsequent paper detailing the research framework and hypothesis development (Ohms 2025f), this study aimed to holistically assess the complex interplay between biases, decision-making stages, and moderating factors. The robust methodological design (Ohms 2025e) and data validation procedures (Ohms 2025a), including outlier detection, normality assessment, and reliability testing, provided the essential foundation for advanced statistical analysis. This paper specifies, estimates, and systematically refines the SEM model through a backward elimination strategy. It elaborates on the choice of a robust estimator, the interpretation of various model fit indices (e.g., Chi-square, CFI, TLI, RMSEA, AIC, BIC), and the iterative selection of the most simplified yet well-fitting model (Model 15).

gnbqf_v1,The Moderating Effect of Time Pressure on the Relationship between Cognitive Biases and Information Processing in the Singaporean Workplace,"This paper investigates the moderating role of time pressure on the relationships between three prominent cognitive biases, Overconfidence Bias (OB), Herding Bias (HB), and Decision Avoidance Bias (AB), and two stages of workplace decision-making: Evaluating Information (EI) and Searching Information (SI). Building from the theoretical foundation established by Ohms (2025h) and the significant research gaps noted by Ohms (2025i),  this study uses a cross-sectional, mono-quantitative survey methodology (Ohms (2025g) of 365 employees in Singapore. Additionally, Ohms (2025a) documented the data validation and preliminary analysis, which provided a concrete basis for more complex analyses. Hence, this paper builds upon the analysis of direct effects reported by Ohms (2025b, 2025c) and applies the specific methodological procedures for moderation detailed by Ohms (2025e). Results from multiple regression with robust standard errors show that time pressure does not significantly moderate the strong effects of overconfidence and herding biases on either stage of information processing. However, time pressure moderates the relationship between decision avoidance and information evaluation by weakening the negative impact of avoidance. These results contribute to behavioural economics and provide helpful information for organisational decision-making in the Singaporean workplace by emphasising the selective nature of time pressure as a contextual stressor.",2025-09-16T20:13:10.342050,"Behavioral Economics,Cognitive Biases,Decision Quality,Moderating Variable,Organizational Practice,Singapore,Stressors,Time Pressure,Workplace Decision-Making",,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/gnbqf_v1/,,psyarxiv

The model suggests that individuals strongly identified with their group in a narcissistic way are motivated to avoid information threatening ingroup image, especially when they also seek cognitive certainty. This deliberate ignorance serves to protect group image and reinforce prejudice. The framework applies symmetrically to both religious (Catholics) and non-religious (atheists) groups, highlighting a universal psychological mechanism.

97tkx_v1,Measuring Cognitive Functioning in Older Adults Using Artificial Intelligence Chatbot Narrative Interviews,"This study examined whether older adults (age 55+) could effectively interact with an Intelligent Cognitive Assistant (ICA) chatbot during a narrative interview, how they perceived the system, and whether textual data from the interview could be used to assess cognitive ability and relate to cognitive functioning and health outcomes. Participants were recruited from Prolific, a crowdsourcing platform (N = 164), and completed four cognitive ability tasks, a narrative interview with an ICA, and a battery of survey measures. Our findings indicate that older adults can engage meaningfully with an ICA and provide enough textual cues to assess personality on par with previous studies on younger adult samples. These older adults also reported that they enjoyed the interaction and found it easy to use and concentrate throughout the interview. We were able to use the textual responses from the narrative interview to assess cognitive ability to a limited extent, primarily capturing aspects of verbal fluency; however, correlations of narrative-based cognitive ability scores with self-reported cognitive functioning and health outcomes were weak. Overall, these results suggest that ICA systems are not only feasible but also engaging and easy for older adults to use. This presents a promising first step towards the development of automated, scalable tools for cognitive evaluation. We encourage future research to design and validate an ICA system specifically for cognitive evaluation.",2025-09-14T06:03:10.162281,,,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/97tkx_v1/,,psyarxiv
79kqs_v1,"Object recognition ability predicts  episodic location memory, enhanced by meaningfulness","People differ in their ability to distinguish visually similar items, a domain-general ability known as o (Richler et al., 2019). While o typically involves extracting invariant object properties, we investigated whether it also relates to long-term memory for episodic information extrinsic to object identity, specifically, object location. We further examined whether this relationship is influenced by stimulus meaningfulness, a factor known to enhance long-term memory, by using both high- and low-meaning stimuli. Participants completed a location memory test, a series of visual object-recognition tasks assessing o, and other cognitive covariate measures. Results showed a positive correlation between o and location memory, which was stronger for high-meaning than for low-meaning stimuli. This suggests that semantic content may enhance the link between object recognition and episodic location memory. Importantly, these effects remained after controlling for age, gender, low-level visual perception, working memory, and general intelligence. Our findings indicate that domain-general object recognition ability contributes to episodic memory by supporting the binding of meaningful objects to their spatial context. This challenges traditional cognitive boundaries by integrating current knowledge about individual differences in perception and memory, with semantic meaning acting as a significant moderator.",2025-09-14T05:40:35.607772,Object recognition; Long-term memory; Semantic meaning,,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/79kqs_v1/,,psyarxiv

This study aimed to assess the neurocognitive status of middle-aged individuals in an industrialized area and to examine associations with demographic and lifestyle factors that may contribute to cognitive vulnerability.
Methods: Ninety-four participants (27 males and 67 females), aged 40–65 years (mean age = 50), were recruited. NCA was assessed using the Bangla version of the Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination III (ACE-III).
Results: The mean overall NCA score was 67.5, which falls below the cutoff point. The prevalence of MCI was 60%. Significant risk factors (p&lt;0.05) associated with MCI included age, sex, educational attainment, and low levels of physical activity.
Conclusions: Findings suggest that middle-aged individuals living in an industrialized city are in a vulnerable position regarding neurocognitive health. A substantial proportion are already experiencing MCI, placing them at elevated risk of progressing to dementia in later life.

j9426_v2,Cognitive and Affective Empathy in Binge-Drinking during Late Adolescence,"Empathy–the ability to understand and share the feelings of others–has been identified
as a potential correlate of binge drinking behaviors in adolescence. Our preregistered study
aimed to investigate the relationship between cognitive and affective empathy and alcohol
consumption in late adolescence. Building on prior research, we predicted a dissociation of
cognitive and affective empathy related to alcohol consumption. Specifically, we hypothesized
that whereas a negative association between affective empathy and alcohol consumption would
emerge, no significant association would be observed for cognitive empathy. To test these
hypotheses, we surveyed a convenience sample of U.S. college students (N = 116; ages 18-23;
73.28 % women). The online survey comprised questions assessing drinking behavior
(categorized as non-binge drinking, binge drinking, and extreme binge drinking), engagement in
hazardous drinking behavior (continuous measure), and self-reported empathic traits.
We found that binge drinking categories and hazardous drinking scores were closely
aligned, suggesting that the two measures capture similar aspects of drinking behavior. Men
reported more problematic drinking patterns than women, who also tended to show higher
affective empathy. Age was positively related to hazardous drinking, with participants at the
upper end of the age range reporting riskier alcohol use. Contrary to our preregistered
hypotheses, we found no significant relationship between affective empathy and engagement in
binge drinking or hazardous drinking among late adolescents. Cognitive empathy, as predicted,
was not related to the extremity of alcohol consumption. Additionally, we observed a striking
pattern in our data: 20.69 % of our sample indicated extreme binge drinking (EBD), which is
significantly higher than the 12% reported by a U.S. national survey conducted in 2020. While
the relationship between drinking behavior and empathy may be more nuanced than expected,
the observed disparity in EBD behavior emphasizes the importance of addressing its prevalence
within U.S. college communities and implementing proactive measures to promote responsible
alcohol consumption during late adolescence.",2025-09-13T16:09:47.774361,"adolescence,affective empathy,alcohol consumption,binge drinking,cognitive empathy,empathy,high-intensity drinking,late adolescence",,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/j9426_v2/,,psyarxiv

Building on prior methodological frameworks, the study ensured data quality through systematic data management, outlier detection and normality testing. Outliers were identified using univariate and multivariate approaches, while normality was evaluated using statistical (Shapiro–Wilk and Kolmogorov–Smirnov) and visual (skewness, kurtosis, histograms and QQ plots) approaches. Demographic and descriptive analyses provided baseline insights into sample characteristics and variable distributions. The reliability of measurement instruments was confirmed using Cronbach’s alpha and item–total correlations. These procedures demonstrate data integrity and offer guidance for similar studies in behavioural economics and management, particularly in under-researched geographical contexts such as Singapore. Results also establish the basis for future studies on how overconfidence, herding and decision avoidance biases influence workplace decision-making, including evaluating information, searching information and procrastination.",2025-09-13T16:18:44.111577,"cognitive bias,decision-making,singapore,workplace",,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/vhjtf_v1/,,psyarxiv
9zsf6_v1,Cognitive Aging and Decision Making in the Twilight of Mnemonic Uncertainty,"Memory is both a powerful asset and a source of internal uncertainty in decision making.
Cognitive changes across adulthood may amplify this internal (or epistemic) uncertainty,
depending on the memory system or task involved. For instance, age-related declines in episodic
and working memory likely increase mnemonic uncertainty and shape the strategies that people
use when making judgments or decision from memory. This article first discusses research on
age-related differences in memory and decision making and then introduces a novel perspective
that integrates findings from cognitive aging, decision science, and from metamemory research.
A methodological framework is proposed to experimentally investigate mnemonic uncertainty
using utility and computational models of value-based decision making. The approach enables
the systematic quantification of mnemonic uncertainty and of the valuation of outcomes,
providing a foundation for advancing our conceptual understanding of how these processes shape
decisions from memory.",2025-09-12T04:44:53.910230,,,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/9zsf6_v1/,,psyarxiv
2xwdz_v1,Internet Cognitive Therapy for Prolonged Grief Disorder (iCT-PG): A developmental case series,"Background:
Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD) affects a significant minority of bereaved individuals and is associated with persistent distress, comorbidity, and functional impairment. Access to evidence-based treatment remains limited. This study introduces and evaluates Internet Cognitive Therapy for Prolonged Grief (iCT-PG), a therapist-assisted digital intervention adapted from iCT-PTSD.
Objective:
To assess preliminary feasibility, acceptability, and clinical outcomes of iCT-PG, and its impact on key cognitive maintenance mechanisms of PGD.
Methods:
Eight adults meeting diagnostic criteria for PGD completed the 12-session iCT-PG programme over 14 weeks. The intervention targeted loss-related memory characteristics, negative grief appraisals, a sense of social disconnection, and unhelpful coping strategies, and used a personalised digital modular approach and therapist support through weekly calls and messages. Outcomes were assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up using validated measures.
Results:
All participants completed treatment. Large reductions in PGD symptoms and comorbid symptoms of PTSD, depression, anxiety, and functional impairment were observed. At post-treatment, 87.5% (7/8) demonstrated both reliable improvement in PGD symptoms on the Reliable Change Index, and recovery below clinical cut-offs. There was no reliable deterioration on any measure. Process measures showed large effect sizes, with the strongest improvements in loss-related memory characteristics. Therapeutic gains were maintained at 3-month follow-up. Average therapist time was approximately 10 hours per participant.
Conclusions:
iCT-PG was feasible, well-accepted, and associated with substantial clinical improvement. The intervention successfully targeted mechanisms known to maintain PGD, supporting its theoretical foundation. Though uncontrolled and small in sample size, findings support further evaluation in larger trials to determine efficacy and scalability.",2025-09-11T16:32:53.946219,,,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/2xwdz_v1/,,psyarxiv
z4ruj_v2,Attention hijacked: How social media notifications disrupt cognitive processing,"Digital notifications are ubiquitous in modern life, yet their impact on cognitive performance remains poorly understood. Here, we introduce an ecologically valid paradigm to examine how social media notifications disrupt ongoing task performance. Participants completed a Stroop task while receiving smartphone-style notifications, allowing us to track both behavioural and physiological responses. Notifications triggered a transient slowdown in cognitive processing lasting approximately seven seconds, driven by the combined influence of perceptual salience, learned associations, and relevance appraisal. The magnitude of this disruption was predicted by the inferred relevance of notifications and by individual patterns of smartphone use—specifically, the frequency of interaction (notification volume and checking behaviour) rather than total time spent on the device. These findings were mirrored in changes in pupil dilation, a physiological marker of cognitive load, confirming the convergent impact of notification relevance and smartphone habits. Together, our results show that modern digital cues can hijack attentional resources, even in the absence of explicit personal relevance. They underscore the need to account for notification frequency—not merely screen time—when evaluating the cognitive cost of pervasive digital environments, and raise broader concerns about the long-term impact of habitual device interaction on attentional functioning.",2025-09-11T13:18:18.064543,"Attention disruption,Emotional response,Smartphone use,Social media notification,User behaviors",,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/z4ruj_v2/,,psyarxiv

However, standardized, cross-national assessments of cognitive functioning are currently scarce. This study examined the psychometric properties of the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe, Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (SHARE-HCAP), a newly developed instrument for assessing cognitive functioning in Europe. 
Method: 2685 respondents aged 65 years and older in Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany and Italy were included in the study. Confirmatory factor analyses were used to examine the construct validity of SHARE-HCAP’s cognitive test battery. Based on theory and prior empirical work, unidimensional models representing the cognitive domains of memory, executive functioning, visuospatial skills, language and fluency, and orientation were tested. Additionally, we examined a correlated factor model and a second-order factor model that included a latent factor representing general cognitive performance. Criterion validity was established by examining the association between the single factor scores and level of educational attainment and age. 
Results: A second-order factor structure showed adequate model fit, suggesting five domains of cognition and a general cognitive performance latent factor. Greater single factor scores were associated with higher educational attainment and younger age. Approximate measurement invariance across the five countries was supported. 
Conclusions: Results suggest that the SHARE-HCAP is a psychometrically sound neuropsychological test battery and is a valuable tool for cross-national comparisons of cognitive health.",2025-09-15T20:32:55.684228,"cognitive impairment,cross-cultural,dementia,factor analysis,test development",,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/qr3yc_v1/,,psyarxiv
t5zbc_v3,The Role of Speech Perception Gradiency in L1 versus L2 Spoken Word Recognition,"Speech perception gradiency reflects sensitivity to subphonemic differences. Prior research has shown that gradiency facilitates recovery from misperceptions (i.e., speech perception flexibility) in L1 (Kapnoula et al., 2021), but whether and how gradiency contributes to speech perception flexibility in L2 remains unknown. This study investigated the role of gradiency in spoken word recognition among Spanish (L1)-English (L2) bilinguals. Gradiency was assessed using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) with stop consonants (/b/-/p/), and initial lexical activation and speech perception flexibility were assessed using an eye-tracking Visual World Paradigm (VWP) task. Seventy Spanish-English bilinguals completed these tasks in both languages. Following previous results in L1 English, gradiency facilitated speech perception flexibility in L1 Spanish. In contrast, gradiency did not facilitate L2 speech perception, and a different pattern emerged: participants relied more heavily on lexical (top-down) than subphonemic (bottom-up) information, especially lower-L2-proficiency listeners. Additionally, a positive correlation between L1 and L2 gradiency was observed only among higher-proficiency listeners. Overall, these findings suggest that the functional role of gradiency in L1 versus L2 speech perception is modulated by the differential reliance on bottom-up versus top-down information.",2025-09-11T16:59:14.769463,"bilingualism,bottom-up,categorical perception,eye-tracking,gradiency,individual differences,lexical garden path,perceptual consistency,speech perception,top-down,visual analogue scale,visual world paradigm",,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/t5zbc_v3/,,psyarxiv

mindfulness, neuroeducation, and metacognition, aiming to enhance psychological well-being
and performance in practical settings. Building on a systematic review and meta-analysis
following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, the study investigates whether integrating these three
domains can lead to gains in psychological well-being and job satisfaction, as well as reducing
stress, depressive symptoms and anxiety. The findings suggest that multi-method interventions
tend to have moderate-to-strong effects on well-being and stress reduction, though improvements
in job satisfaction appear somewhat more restrained. While each of these components has shown
promise individually, their combined impact remains relatively underexplored in both academic
literature and applied practice. Neuroawareness is introduced here as an attempt to fill that gap,
offering a more coherent, cross-disciplinary approach to cognitive intervention. The discussion
considers what this might mean for fields like education, healthcare, and workplace

To investigate the effect of Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) on memory performance and slow-wave activity (SWA) in older adults with insomnia disorder. 2. To determine whether changes in SWA are linked to improvements in memory performance. 3. To assess how the individual therapies of CBT-I treatment contribute to these effects. Methods: A secondary analysis was conducted using data from 104 older adults with insomnia disorder enrolled in a clinical trial examining the impact of CBT-I, Behavioral Therapy (BT), and Cognitive Therapy (CT) on insomnia severity. Participants were randomized to six sessions of BT, CT, or CBT-I (combined BT and CT). They underwent polysomnography and RBANS memory testing ––assessing immediate (List Learning and Story Memory) and delayed memory (List Recall, Story Recall, Figure Recall, and List Recognition)–– at baseline and at 6-month follow-up. Linear-mixed effects models examined the impact of treatment on memory and SWA. Regression analyses examined relationships between changes in SWA and memory following the treatment. Results: Improvements were identified in immediate memory (List Learning and Story Memory) and delayed memory (List Recall, Story Recall, and Figure Recall). The analysis did not reveal significant changes in SWA following treatment. However, there was a significant positive association between improvements in List Learning and increases in SWA. There were no differences in outcomes among the treatments. Conclusions: These findings suggest that BT, CT and CBT-I may enhance memory performance in older adults with insomnia disorder, with a potential link between SWA and immediate memory performance.",2025-09-11T17:02:22.456367,,,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/jdrz7_v1/,,psyarxiv
3w5vb_v1,Positive Bias in Affective Decision Making: Neurocognitive Mechanisms Mediating Links to Resilience,"Biased information processing plays an important role in mental disorders. This study investi-gates biases in value-based decision making and how links to psychological resilience can be accounted for by individual differences in the cognitive and neural processing of affective in-formation. Decision making was studied in 82 people (41 female, 41 male; age: 18–37 years) using a cost-benefit integration task. Neural activity was recorded via fMRI, cognitive pro-cessing modeled with an evidence-accumulation model. Choice bias was positively associated with self-reported resilience (particularly the facet ‘acceptance’) – and this association was me-diated by differences in the neural processing of affective information during decision making: Participants with a more positive bias and higher resilience showed stronger increases in neural activity in response to loss in ten prefrontal and parietal brain regions – and stronger decreases in response to gain in the right inferior frontal junction. Cognitive-computational modeling re-vealed that more positive biases were associated with lower sensitivity to and lower valuation of negative information – along with relatively higher sensitivity to and higher valuation of positive information. Notably, higher valuation of positive information was associated with stronger neural responses to negative information in dACC and bilateral insula. Finally, bias and resili-ence were associated with differential functional connectivity between prefrontal seeds, midbrain, striatum, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. The findings suggest that stronger activation of brain regions associated with cognitive control – specifically in response to negative information – promotes a positive cognitive bias in affective decision making that may support resilience to mental disorders.",2025-09-10T14:50:49.905265,"value-based decision making, cognitive bias, evidence accumulation, drift rate, mediation",,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/3w5vb_v1/,,psyarxiv
xchnz_v2,Deep latent variable joint cognitive modeling of neural signals and human behavior,"As the field of computational cognitive neuroscience continues to expand and generate new theories, there is a growing need for more advanced methods to test the hypothesis of brain-behavior relationships. Recent progress in Bayesian cognitive modeling has enabled the combination of neural and behavioral models into a single unifying framework. However, these approaches require manual feature extraction, and lack the capability to discover previously unknown neural features in more complex data. Consequently, this would hinder the expressiveness of the models. To address these challenges, we propose a Neurocognitive Variational Autoencoder (NCVA) to conjoin high-dimensional EEG with a cognitive model in both generative and predictive modeling analyses. Importantly, our NCVA enables both the prediction of EEG signals given behavioral data and the estimation of cognitive model parameters from EEG signals. This novel approach can allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the triplet relationship between behavior, brain activity, and cognitive processes.",2025-09-24T16:38:08.544019,"Decision making,Deep learning,Drift-diffusion model,EEG,Latent-variable models,Neurocognitive model,Variational Bayes",10.1016/j.neuroimage.2024.120559,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/xchnz_v2/,,psyarxiv
qskmj_v1,Cognitive control in music: adaptive strategy for pitch identification across the absolute-pitch proficiency continuum,"Although absolute pitch (AP) is often celebrated as a rare musical gift, Western tonal music relies on relative pitch (RP), where meaning depends on intervals to the tonic. This contrast furnishes a natural test bed for cognitive control: AP is an automatic, stimulus-bound code, whereas RP requires context-dependent computation. We tested 50 non–music-major students spanning the AP proficiency continuum on a movable-Do solfa-naming task under three tonal contexts of rising difficulty (fixed C major, fixed B major, randomly shifting keys). AP gave an overall advantage, yet error pattern and response time analyses showed systematic strategy switching among AP possessors: (i) AP use in C major, (ii) pitch name transposition in B major, and (iii) interval/chord listening in random keys, with individual differences. Non AP participants relied on RP across conditions. Thus, scale note identification recruits adaptive strategy selection governed by AP proficiency, tonal context, and cognitive load, illustrating cognitive control in a naturalistic musical task and motivating tailored ear training in music education.",2025-09-10T15:00:47.865150,,,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/qskmj_v1/,,psyarxiv

The multilevel vector autoregressive (ML-VAR) model revealed functional impairment nodes due to depression and anxiety are central in the temporal network structure. Subsequent network comparisons showed the ML-VAR structures for non-responders were denser than the responders’ structures.

y7e58_v1,A Cognitive Model of Cued Trials Task-Switching Performance,"Task-switching paradigms have been used to investigate cognitive control processes, emulating everyday tasks which require regulating cognitive resources. Cognitive modelling approaches, in the context of task-switching have sought to identify constituent processes contributing to task-switching performance. However, these approaches have typically used diffusion decision models (DDM) that are not designed to capture task-switching behaviour. Here, we extend a recent model of task-switching (Steyvers et al., 2019) to capture the complex dynamics of task activation in a cued-trials task-switching paradigm in a sample of community-dwelling older adults (n=177, 60-70 years). The model is based on an evidence-accumulation architecture extended to incorporate cognitive processes associated with task-set maintenance and updating that occur in the cue-target interval, namely task-set activation and deactivation. Results show that, with the additional processes associated with task activation, the model captures qualitative and quantitative trends in behavioural data that are consistent with task-switching literature (e.g., switch cost, mixing cost, and congruency costs) and provides a strong, quantitative basis for some of the theoretically proposed processes underlying task-switching performance (e.g., task activation). On examination of the parameter values of the weakest and strongest performers on five different task-switching metrics, the model provided unique insights into individual differences on the cognitive processes driving performance in cued trials task-switching behaviour. By disentangling key cognitive processes thought to underlie task switching performance (e.g., task set reconfiguration and task set inertia), our model provides greater precision with which to describe the underlying processes that have been observed beyond the standard mean RT measures.",2025-09-17T03:33:39.191806,,,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/y7e58_v1/,,psyarxiv
4ytpw_v1,Coupled Cognitive and Social Development From Childhood To Adolescence: Behavioral Problems Linked To Lower Levels and Less Social-Cognitive Integration,"Cognitive skills tend to grow and change in interdependent ways across development, yet it remains unclear whether (a) early patterns of cognitive coupling depend on social-skill development and (b) whether individual differences in such coupling have predictive value for later behavioral outcomes. We addressed these questions using eight repeated assessments from the NICHD–SECCYD longitudinal study, tracking children from early childhood through adolescence. Using continuous-time structural equation models, we modelled dynamic, reciprocal interactions among cognitive (e.g., vocabulary, attention, memory, executive functioning) and social (e.g., assertion, cooperation, responsibility, self-control, peer competence) domains from age 4.5 to 15 years. Cognitive traits showed stronger overall growth and rank-order stability than social traits, whereas social-emotional skills displayed tighter internal coupling. Executive functioning emerged as a central connector across domains, showing robust cross-domain associations with multiple social skills. Children who exhibited more behavioral problems at age 15 had weaker early cross-domain trait correlations—particularly between (rather than within) cognitive and social domains—indicating lower early developmental integration. By adolescence, these children showed increased cohesion within the cognitive domain but reduced coupling with social traits, suggesting a shift toward domain-specific rather than integrated development. These findings highlight how early differences in the co-development of cognitive and social abilities may shape later behavioral adjustment, supporting a dynamic, systems-level view of developmental risk and adaptation.",2025-09-09T15:52:32.418886,,,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/4ytpw_v1/,,psyarxiv

In the current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we examined the spatial patterns and task-induced blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) changes associated with attentional control deficits in participants with schizophrenia relative to neurotypical participants. We employed a cognitive paradigm that required participants to alternated between three judgment tasks (i.e., identifying colours, parity, or letter case), while being presented with stimuli comprised of  one (univalent), two (bivalent), or three (trivalent) dimension(s). Three cognitive modes were detected: (1) Multiple Demand (MD), (2) Language (LAN), and (3) Default mode B (DM-B). Participants with schizophrenia showed impaired task performance, muted but sustained activations of the MD mode, hypo-activations of the LAN mode, and hyper-deactivations of the DM-B mode relative to neurotypical participants. Thus, attentional control impairments in individuals with schizophrenia are likely due to disrupted activity of the MD, LAN, and DM-B modes. Additionally, in participants with schizophrenia, the sustained activation of the MD mode in the Trivalent condition was associated with higher scores on positive symptoms (hallucinations and delusions), while the reduced activation of the LAN mode in the Trivalent condition and the pronounced deactivation of the DM-B mode in the Univalent condition were associated with higher scores on negative symptoms (i.e., poverty of speech and flattened affect). Our findings highlight the contributions of fMRI to individualized medicine due to symptom-specific effects, and identifying potential targets for neuromodulation techniques that aim to restore BOLD activity and improve cognitive function in schizophrenia.",2025-09-09T14:38:29.457415,,,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/zyvq2_v1/,,psyarxiv
ebcr5_v1,Prefrontal tDCS-Augmented Brief Memory Training in Older Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial of Cognitive and Brain Network Plasticity,"Cognitive aging is characterized by declining memory and reduced segregation of large-scale brain networks. While memory training and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) each show potential to support neurocognitive function in older adults, their combined effect on cognitive outcomes remains an active line of research and effects on whole-brain network modularity remain unclear. Additionally, recent studies suggest that tDCS may accelerate the cognitive benefits of memory training. We tested whether five days of training working memory (WM) and long-term memory (LTM), paired with anodal tDCS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, would enhance these memory domains and increase resting-state functional network modularity. 62 healthy older adults were randomly assigned to receive either active or sham stimulation during adaptive WM and LTM training, with resting-state fMRI collected at baseline, post-test, and follow-up 2-4 months after training. Behavioral results indicated no significant improvements in WM or LTM over time, and stimulation condition did not reliably modulate performance. Similarly, resting-state modularity did not change significantly across the training period, nor were there differences between stimulation groups. Exploratory analyses revealed that task-based modularity increased from post-test to follow-up in the active group, though this effect was not accompanied by behavioral gains. Further exploratory analyses revealed that across all outcomes, baseline measurements (irrespective of condition) emerged as strong moderators of change over the training period, emphasizing the importance of interindividual variability. By integrating memory training with tDCS and longitudinal fMRI, this study adds to the growing literature on stimulation-augmented cognitive training protocols and underscore the need for research on interindividual differences.",2025-09-08T21:19:57.136077,"aging,memory training,modularity,neuroplasticity,resting-state fMRI,tDCS",,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/ebcr5_v1/,,psyarxiv
gzpvn_v1,The metacognitive underpinnings of effective cognitive teamwork,"Groups often outperform individuals in cognitive tasks. However, there is little consensus on the cognitive mechanisms that underlie effective teamwork. Here we propose that metacognitive awareness—an individual’s ability to understand and reflect on their own cognitive processes as well as those of their peers—plays a critical role in facilitating effective group work. This ability includes recognizing not only one’s own strengths and weaknesses but also understanding the knowledge states, skills, and needs of fellow group members. Metacognitively aware team members can leverage each other’s expertise, adjust their communication styles appropriately, and collaborate more efficiently. However, interaction can also have deleterious consequences, such as when one member chooses to dominate, when social conditions make group members reluctant to contribute or to evaluate others’ contributions frankly, or when the coordination among group members is sufficiently burdensome that it interferes with individual performance. Here we propose that effective group work results from harnessing the knowledge that is held in many minds by creating conditions for optimal sorting and evaluation of group suggestions through the effective exchange of metacognitive information. We examine the existing literature on group cognition across a number of fields, including psychology, cognitive science, organization, and management, and identify a number of key metacognitive strategies that exemplify this strategy and enhance group performance.",2025-09-09T00:08:47.077624,"collective intelligence,group decision-making,metacognition,wisdom of crowds",,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/gzpvn_v1/,,psyarxiv
eswn4_v1,Diverging Influences of Punishment Motivation and Negative Affect on Cognitive Control,"The modulation of cognitive control by threat of punishment has been under-characterized relative to examinations of reward, with mixed findings reported in the literature. Across two experiments, we examined the balance of proactive and reactive control in the AX-CPT under several negative affect and punishment manipulations. In Experiment 1, we compared cognitive control performance between two task phases: an Affect phase, in which emotionally evocative images were used to induce either Fear, Anger, or Neutral affect, and a Punishment phase, in which the threat of receiving mild electric shocks was either performance-contingent, or unavoidable. In Experiment 2, we examined cognitive control under punishment that was both unavoidable and uncertain, and whether effects of such punishment varied by individual differences in trait anxiety and intolerance of uncertainty. Across both experiments, we observed that threat of punishment was associated with increased proactive control, and that this effect was heightened when punishment was performance-contingent. In contrast, punishment uncertainty did not appear to modulate cognitive control outcomes at the group level. However, exploratory analyses suggested that punishment uncertainty might interact with individual variability in trait anxiety, intolerance of uncertainty, and threat-related physiological arousal responses to shape control outcomes. Together, our findings support an account in which the presence of a motivator, regardless of valence, facilitates increased proactive control. In contrast, the relationship between negative affect and cognitive control outcomes may be more complex, and vary both with contextual factors and individual differences.",2025-09-08T20:27:21.038960,"cognitive control,motivation,negative affect,punishment,threat",,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/eswn4_v1/,,psyarxiv

Here, we resolve this paradox by shifting from trait-level to state-level assessments of cognition. Leveraging a micro-task design to measure daily fluctuations in cognitive function, goal setting and goal progress, mood, sleep, and motivation over a 12-week intensive longitudinal study of university students (N=184, timepoints=9,248), we show that within person upswings in domain-general information processing precision precede and predict same-day self-reported goal achievement across domains, even after controlling for other factors. A one standard deviation change in this cognitive capacity translated to the behavioral equivalent of ~40 minutes of work, with similar or larger predictive effects compared to fluctuations in mood/motivation and no moderation by trait-level self-control or conscientiousness. Our work addresses long standing controversies and highlights the power of intra individual analysis to reveal relationships missed by cross sectional approaches.",2025-09-09T17:02:59.322923,Intention-behaviour gap; Goal achievement; Intensive longitudinal data; Self-control; Drift diffusion model,,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/srt39_v1/,,psyarxiv
adqe2_v1,Endogenous Attention Effects on Metacognitive Awareness:  A Pilot DLPFC-cTBS Study,"Background: Visual metacognitive sensitivity may depend on prior expectations, which are shaped by top-down attentional control via the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).
Objective/hypothesis: In Experiment 1, we employed a well-established two-alternative forced-choice discrimination task with Posner cueing to test whether spatial attention modulates perceptual metacognition. In Experiment 2, we applied bilateral continuous theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (cTBS) over the DLPFC and a control site to assess whether the DLPFC is critical for this attentional modulation.
Methods: In Experiment 1, a within-subjects design was used with two simultaneous adaptive staircases for valid and invalid trials to control task difficulty, while reaction times, signal detection theory metrics and metacognitive efficiency were measured. In Experiment 2, the same task was performed in two sessions spaced by a week following cTBS over the DLPFC or control cortices, adding non-parametric metacognitive and cognitive control measures.
Results: In Experiment 1, objective performance was successfully stabilized while leaving subjective responses unconstrained. Reaction times, response bias, and metacognitive efficiency were all impaired following invalid cues. In Experiment 2, the same pattern was observed after S1-cTBS, but critically, DLPFC-cTBS erased these attentional effects, indicating that DLPFC disruption selectively impairs the modulation of metacognitive monitoring. Trial-history analyses further corroborated that the DLPFC supports conflict-adaptation across trials.
Conclusion(s): These findings suggest that the DLPFC does not generate perceptual contents directly but is essential for the top-down processes that shape metacognitive monitoring. Disrupting DLPFC function reduces attentional benefits and conflict-adaptation in metacognition, highlighting its critical role in linking expectations to self-evaluative awareness.",2025-09-08T16:03:05.940223,"attention,consciousness,cTBS,DLPFC,metacognition,Posner task",,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/adqe2_v1/,,psyarxiv
u9jbk_v2,"Widening participation in cognitive neuroscience research: A mixed-methods study of motivators, barriers and attitudes towards imaging methods in young and older adults","Cognitive neuroscience research often relies on convenience sampling of participants, which can result in biased sample demographics and an under-representation of older adults. There is a need to identify effective routes to widen participation among older adults and explore age-related differences in motivations and barriers to research involvement. This mixed methods study combines qualitative data from two focus groups, conducted with 11 healthy adults aged 56-73, and an online questionnaire completed by 335 adults aged 18-88. Analysis of the focus group discussions identified 3 main themes: a) the importance of receiving transparent information about study aims, procedures and safety, b) distinguishing between medical and non-medical research, and c) contributing to the “collective good”. The questionnaire echoed that altruism and the prospect of scientific discovery are increasingly important motivators with advancing age, whereas financial incentives become less important. Older adults have more free time to participate, are less deterred by the prospect of pain, and express more trust in researchers than younger people. Attitudes towards different imaging methods (MRI, EEG, NIBS and Eye tracking) varied, with fewest negative emotions for eye-tracking and most for non-invasive brain stimulation, but positive attitudes generally increased and negative attitudes reduced with age. These findings highlight the importance of tailoring recruitment strategies to different age groups to enhance diversity in cognitive neuroscience research. Improving communication, addressing practical barriers, and framing studies in a meaningful context may help increase participation among groups who are traditionally underrepresented in neuroimaging research.",2025-09-08T13:56:29.364489,"Aging,Cognitive Neuroscience,EDI,Neuroimaging,Widening participation",,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/u9jbk_v2/,,psyarxiv
nmhek_v2,The rise and fall of semantic cognition: Knowledge accumulation in later life is offset by declines in semantic control,"Semantic cognition (use of acquired world knowledge to guide behaviour) is critical in everyday life. Semantic cognition is often assumed to be preserved in later life, compensating for functional declines in other cognitive domains. However, aging research rarely considers age-related effects on non-verbal knowledge or on semantic control processes that regulate how knowledge is activated and used. We addressed this by conducting the most detailed assessment of semantic cognition across the adult lifespan to date, involving 537 UK adults aged between 20 and 91. Verbal semantic knowledge increased linearly across adulthood while non-verbal knowledge reached a plateau at age 60. In contrast, controlled semantic processing showed age-related decline, particularly in the ability to inhibit task-irrelevant semantic knowledge. These results indicate that semantic cognition is not uniformly preserved in old age: though older people know more than young people, they are less able to use their knowledge flexibly in novel situations.",2025-09-08T16:17:04.867049,,,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/nmhek_v2/,,psyarxiv
8n9kq_v1,Parsing inhibitory and mnemonic contributions to age-related decline in cognitive flexibility,"Cognitive flexibility is the ability to shift between mental sets in response to changing goals or environments, and it is known to decline across the adult lifespan. Competing accounts attribute this decline either to weaknesses in specific abilities such as inhibition or memory, or to more global challenges in managing the interaction between them. Efforts to disentangle contributing processes through targeted, single-function tasks have produced mixed findings, potentially due to confounding variability in stimuli and task demands.
The current work contributes to the field's understanding of cognitive flexibility decline by focusing on \emph{inhibition} as both a subcomponent and as an independent process, given its central role in both specific-deficit and integrative theoretical accounts. In particular, we designed a unified task that engages both 1) cognitive flexibility through shifting requirements to encode task-relevant mental sets and inhibit them once they become outdated; and 2) discrete item-level inhibition of perceptual distractors. We tested 86 adults aged 18–73. Accuracy analyses revealed asymmetric interaction effects between aging and these two operations: while learning after a rule-switch worsened as age increased, inhibition of perceptual distractors inhibition improved. We then applied a computational model to quantify how memory precision and the inhibition of previously-relevant sets each contributed to performance. Model fits indicated that age-related decline in learning across rule-switches were driven primarily by reduced memory precision, not by deficits in inhibition.",2025-09-09T19:41:01.083154,,,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/8n9kq_v1/,,psyarxiv
86xbd_v1,A Recipe for Dyadic Collective Intelligence for Well-Structured Tasks: Mix Equal Parts Cognitive Ability and Confidence Plus a Pinch of Social Sensitivity,"A collective intelligence factor (CI) was introduced by prior research to characterize the cognitive ability of groups. Surprisingly, individual intelligence did not predict CI. Instead, it correlated with individual social sensitivity, the equality of conversational turn-taking and the proportion of females in a group. However, these findings may depend on the type of tasks completed by groups. Our study re-examined these relationships by (1) testing the robustness of the CI factor in dyads using well-structured tasks guided by the Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) model of intelligence; (2) exploring the relationship between dyadic CI and metacognitive confidence, which is known to influence group processes and outcomes; and (3) identifying the psychological characteristics of distinct dyad types using Latent Profile Analysis.
We measured CI in 105 undergraduate dyads using three group tasks aligned with the broad abilities of the CHC model. Individual intelligence was assessed using Raven’s Advanced Progressive Matrices. We also measured social sensitivity, proportion of females, equality of turn taking, working memory, and personality.
Results indicated that individual intelligence and confidence were the strongest predictors of dyadic CI for well-structured tasks, contrasting with previous findings emphasizing social factors. While we replicated the relationship with social sensitivity, we did not replicate the findings for equality of turn taking or gender composition. Latent Profile Analysis identified three psychological profiles: dyads performing consistently high individually and collectively, those performing consistently low, and those performing better collectively than individually. Our ‘smarter’ dyads consisted of intelligent and confident individuals with higher social sensitivity.
These findings suggest that, in dyads performing well-structured tasks, individual cognitive abilities and confidence play significant roles in CI. This challenges the emphasis on social factors and underscores the importance of task selection.",2025-09-07T23:39:01.908544,,,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/86xbd_v1/,,psyarxiv
mrqcp_v1,"The effectiveness of intersecting mindfulness, neuroeducation and meta- cognition on improving perceived well-being and job satisfaction: a systematic review to define “neuroawareness”","This paper proposes “Neuroawareness” as a unified cognitive framework that integrates
mindfulness, neuroeducation, and metacognition, aiming to enhance psychological well-being

domains can lead to gains in psychological well-being and job satisfaction, as well as reducing
stress, depressive symptoms and anxiety. The findings suggest that multi-method interventions
tend to have moderate-to-strong effects on well-being and stress reduction, though improvements
in job satisfaction appear somewhat more restrained. While each of these components has shown
promise individually, their combined impact remains relatively underexplored in both academic
literature and applied practice. Neuroawareness is introduced here as an attempt to fill that gap,
offering a more coherent, cross-disciplinary approach to cognitive intervention. The discussion

of a profusion of competing models. As different models focus on different phenomena, there is
no best model. However, the models share many characteristics, indicating wide agreement on
the mathematics of how memory works in the brain.
On the basis of an analysis of computational memory models, we argue that these models

framework. We present a proof of concept neural implementation, integration with the ACT-R
cognitive architecture, and demonstrate model performance on procedural, declarative, episodic,

I evaluate each model’s ability to account for consistency effects, serial effects, syllable effects, and phonological effects. Consistency effects pose a problem for the rule-based pronunciation of the DRC. Serial effects pose a problem for the purely parallel PDP models. Phonological effects pose a problem for all models save CDP. All models suffer from the distribution problem, weakening each model’s ability to learn spelling-to-sound relationships. LEX is the only model that handles polysyllabic words. As none of the models provide a complete answer to the question of ‘how do we read?’, ‘how do we pronounce?’, or ‘how do we recognize words?’, I outline a set of principles as guidelines for future model development.

This report applies latent class analysis to data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (2015–2020) to examine patterns of subjective cognitive decline in U.S. adults aged 45 and older. Using responses to a structured five-item cognitive function module, three distinct and interpretable subgroups—Mild, Moderate, and Severe cognitive decline—were identified. Each class exhibited unique symptom profiles and socio-demographic associations, with greater severity linked to lower income, lower education levels, and poorer general health. The optimal three-class model was supported by multiple fit indices, including AIC, BIC, entropy, and the Lo-Mendell-Rubin likelihood ratio test. Conditional response probability tables and profile plots further validated the internal structure of the classes. Additional visualizations illustrated the distribution of socioeconomic covariates across latent classes. This analysis underscores the value of latent class analysis for enhancing measurement precision, revealing hidden population structures, and informing targeted interventions. Future research should focus on integrating LCA with causal frameworks, machine learning techniques, and cross-cohort validation to improve its utility in real-world settings.

The results revealed a robust OAB in the younger group, characterized by a reduced Face Inversion Effect (FIE)—more accurate recognition for upright versus inverted faces—when processing older/other-age faces compared to the pronounced FIE for own/younger-age faces. This difference was primarily driven by disrupted performance for upright older faces vs. upright young faces. In contrast, no OAB was observed in the older group, which exhibited a strong FIE for both own/older- and other/younger-age faces, with upright older faces being recognized more accurately than in the younger group.

We then collected subjective ratings of semantic similarities between pairs of meanings/senses within a word and investigated their relation with the similarity of the sensorimotor profiles to corroborate that the sensorimotor-based similarity was semantic in nature. Our results speak in favour of sensorimotor information as a component of representations of polysemous senses / homonymous meanings, and advise future norming studies to take into account lexical ambiguity.",2025-09-06T21:04:34.279845,"embodied cognition,experience verification task,lexical ambiguity,lexical decision task,priming,sensorimotor experience,sensorimotor ratings",,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/g483a_v1/,,psyarxiv

Language is perhaps the most complex behaviour that humans exhibit, and, as such, is one of the most difficult problems for understanding human cognition. Linguistic theory can both inform and be informed by unified models of cognition. We discuss (1) how computational models of human cognition can provide insight into how humans produce and comprehend language and (2) how the problem of modelling language processing raises questions and creates challenges for widely used computational models of cognition. Evidence from the literature suggests that behavioural phenomena, such as recency and priming effects, and cognitive constraints, such as working memory limits, affect how language is produced by humans in ways that can be predicted by computational cognitive models. But just as computational models can provide new insights into language, language can serve as a test for these models. For example, simulating language learning requires the use of more powerful machine learning techniques, such as deep learning and vector symbolic architectures, and language comprehension requires a capacity for on-the-fly situational model construction. In sum, language plays an important role in both shaping the development of a common model of the mind, and, in turn, the theoretical understanding of language stands to benefit greatly from the development of a common model.",2025-09-04T23:05:06.768586,"cognitive architectures,cognitive models,common model of cognition,computational models,human memory,natural language processing",10.1016/j.procs.2018.11.047,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/fwm5g_v3/,,psyarxiv
m9e3c_v1,Learning to Read After Schooling Disruptions: Neurocognitive Correlates of Reading Comprehension in Syrian Refugee Children and Youth,"We examined the development of reading comprehension and its neural underpinnings in the context of disrupted education among Syrian refugee children and youth resettled in Canada. One hundred participants  (Mage = 13.78, SD = 2.55) completed standardized assessments of language comprehension, decoding, and reading comprehension, and participated in functional near-infrared spectroscopy while completing a decoding task. Consistent with the Simple View of Reading (SVR), both language comprehension and decoding significantly predicted reading comprehension. However, the relative role of language comprehension and decoding to reading comprehension differed depending on the extent of educational disruptions experienced during displacement and migration. Decoding predicted reading comprehension for children with minimal education disruptions. However, when educational disruptions were longer due to prolonged displacement, the relation between decoding and reading comprehension was limited, and instead, the relation between language comprehension and reading comprehension was greater. These results suggested that in the context of limited formal literacy instruction during displacement, language comprehension may assume a compensatory function for poor decoding ability. Neuroimaging showed that greater activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) predicted better reading comprehension, suggesting compensatory recruitment beyond the typical left-lateralized reading network. Cluster analyses identified distinct reading profiles that were predicted by neural activation patterns and educational disruption. Children with the highest reading comprehension scores showed greater right IFG activation and lower activation in the supramarginal gyrus (SMG)–a region associated with decoding. Our study extends the SVR by demonstrating that the contribution of decoding and language comprehension to reading comprehension depends on educational experience, and that multiple neural pathways can support reading comprehension after educational disruption. Practically, these results highlight the need for individualized reading interventions and the urgency of minimizing educational disruption for displaced children and youth.",2025-09-04T20:56:39.262811,"fnirs,literacy,neural networks,reading comprehension,refugee,resettlement,simple view of reading",,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/m9e3c_v1/,,psyarxiv

INTRODUCTION, Associations between Amyloid-Tau-Neurodegeneration (ATN) plasma biomarkers and cognition have not  been characterized in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D).
METHODS, Using data from participants in the Glycemic Variability and Fluctuations in Cognitive Status in Adults with T1D study (N=114), associations between phosphorylated tau (pTau)181, pTau217, β-amyloid 42/40 ratio, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light (NfL) and cognition measured by self-administered digital tests were investigated with adjustments for age, sex, education, comorbidities (e.g. kidney disease), and glycemic indices. 
RESULTS, Higher concentrations of pTau181 and GFAP were associated with slower responses on working memory tasks (pTau181: β=0.261 p=0.007; GFAP: β=0.175, p=0.036), and higher β-amyloid 42/40 ratio was associated with better vocabulary (β=0.260, p=0.009). Except for GFAP, these associations remained significant after adjustments. 
DISCUSION, Digital cognitive performance was associated with several ATN plasma biomarkers in T1D adults. Prospective studies are needed to understand the utility of these biomarkers in T1D.",2025-09-04T10:32:02.444876,,10.1002/dad2.70029,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/ujebq_v2/,,psyarxiv

Target word transcription error rates were examined both in sentences and in isolation (recordings excised from same sentences). Errors decreased with increasing model size, but remained heightened for Spanish-accented vs. US-accented speech, roughly similar to human transcribers. Both models and humans benefited from higher sentence predictability. However, sentence context affected models and humans differently: humans benefited only from high- predictability sentences, while models benefited from any sentence context. Humans numerically outperformed the (best-performing) large model on isolated words and showed different error patterns, suggesting Whisper may have a restricted distribution of short utterances or may need lengthier acoustic context than humans. More varied training data and better context awareness, including speaker identity and pragmatic context, might improve ASR generalization.",2025-09-04T10:32:23.998295,"accents &amp; bias,audio-to-text models,Automatic speech recognition,Context",,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/8dhua_v1/,,psyarxiv
aqdhe_v1,An Exploration of Digital Human Cognition through Sensory Perception Across Real and Virtual Selves,"Understanding human cognition in virtual environments (VE) is essential for improving digital human modeling and creating realistic experiences.  By recognizing how context affects sensory perception, designers can more effectively adapt environmental and task-related elements of experience design. This study compared participants' ability to detect and identify sensory cues, namely, passive tactile and olfactory stimuli, between real-life (RL) and VE. We also examined visual context dependency of sensory awareness in order to understand the contribution of environmental elements on sensory awareness.  This study is designed to measure the feeling of being in a real room, detection, identification, and perceived realism, intensity, roughness, and pleasantness of odor and tactile stimuli in both RL and its VE counterpart. Participants were exposed to sensory stimuli with or without visual cues. During the experiment, participants were given listening tasks. This design aims to understand how visual cues affect sensory perception and how different environments shape sensory performance. 
The findings revealed that the feeling of being in a real room in VEs was high when all sensory cues (olfactory, tactile, visual) were present. Notably, in VE, odor detection was more accurate, whereas in RL, surface detection and identification were more reliable. When visual cues were present, participants detected olfactory and tactile cues more effectively. These findings shed light on how sensory perception encountered in RL shapes VE experiences and cognitive processes. These insights could enhance VE experiences by guiding the design of more realistic immersive settings and informing the use of sensory elements in VE design.",2025-09-04T21:16:12.888580,"Digital Human Cognitive Model, Sensory Integration, Virtual Environment Interaction",,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/aqdhe_v1/,,psyarxiv
nzbw7_v1,Cognitive Styles and Student Selection Process for Tertiary Education in Erbil City,"The student selection process is of paramount importance for optimizing the academic performance
of students and colleges. For effective and evidence-based student selection, factors beyond
intellectual capacity, such as cognitive style, must be considered. According to the Empathizing-Systemizing theory, individuals can be classified as 'systemizers' or 'empathizers' based on their cognitive style. Systemizers excel at predictable, systematic thinking, which is suited for fields like mathematics and physics. Empathizers are proficient in understanding social phenomena and typically succeed in fields involving significant human interaction, such as language. Individuals with comparable systemizing and empathizing abilities are classified as 'balanced'. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the student selection process in Erbil city effectively directs systemizers and empathizers into their cognitively suited academic fields. A cross-sectional study was conducted to measure the systemizing and empathizing abilities of 518 students from science, medical, and humanities colleges in Erbil, Iraqi Kurdistan. Students were selected using clustered sampling, and a questionnaire was used to assess their cognitive styles. The final analysis included 93% of the distributed questionnaires. The findings indicated that each academic discipline—sciences, humanities, and medicine—comprised approximately one-third of each brain type (S, N, and E). There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of brain types across these disciplines (p = 0.968). This suggests that a student's brain type does not statistically predict their probability of entering a cognitively suitable academic field. The study's results suggest a defective student selection process in the universities examined, which appears unable to direct students with particular cognitive styles to their appropriate fields. These findings can be partially generalized to other state colleges in Slemani and Duhok, as their students have followed similar academic pathways.",2025-09-06T21:40:52.935418,"ANOVA / quantitative analysis,Cognitive styles,Cross-sectional survey,Educational psychology,Empathizing–Systemizing (E-S) theory,Empathy Quotient (EQ),Erbil,Higher education admissions,Individual differences,Iraq / Kurdistan Region,National Baccalaureate Exam,Psychometrics,STEM vs non-STEM choice,Student selection,Systemizing Quotient (SQ)",,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/nzbw7_v1/,,psyarxiv
kp63w_v2,Reward uncertainty shapes cognitive flexibility,"Recent work has shown that dynamics in reward value is an important driver of the stability-flexibility tradeoff. However, these studies have only examined deterministic reward, while real-world reward is predominantly uncertain and volatile in nature. Therefore, this study aimed to test how reward uncertainty shapes cognitive flexibility. Uncertainty was manipulated by varying the validity of reward cues through stochastic probabilistic reward schedules. Participants performed a voluntary task switching paradigm with performance-contingent monetary reward at two levels. We used linear mixed models in a large (n=616) undergraduate student sample that enabled us to examine individual differences in how gender and personality influence reward-guided task selection. In line with previous work, we observed a reliable effect of reward transition on flexibility, with more flexible task choices when rewards changed from trial-to-trial and more stability when rewards were stable. Critically, this effect decreased linearly with increasing reward uncertainty. Better than expected high reward outcomes were associated with even greater flexibility than expected high outcomes, however, the reverse was not observed for worse than expected outcomes. At higher levels of reward uncertainty, female participants relied more on recent reward outcomes than cues. Overall, males were more influenced by reward transition than females. Perhaps counterintuitively, reward transition effects on flexibility were most apparent in participants with low levels of reward responsiveness. Our findings suggest that reward uncertainty is a key context that tunes the translation of outcomes into future choices.",2025-09-03T20:48:38.584057,"cognitive control,cognitive flexibility,decision making,gender effects,individual differences,linear mixed models,reward,task switching",,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/kp63w_v2/,,psyarxiv
u9jbk_v1,"Widening participation in cognitive neuroscience research: A mixed-methods study of motivators, barriers and attitudes towards imaging methods in young and older adults","Cognitive neuroscience research often relies on convenience sampling of participants, which can result in biased sample demographics and an under-representation of older adults. There is a need to identify effective routes to widen participation among older adults and explore age-related differences in motivations and barriers to research involvement. This mixed methods study combines qualitative data from two focus groups, conducted with 11 healthy adults aged 56-73, and an online questionnaire completed by 335 adults aged 18-88. Analysis of the focus group discussions identified 3 main themes: a) the importance of receiving transparent information about study aims, procedures and safety, b) distinguishing between medical and non-medical research, and c) contributing to the “collective good”. The questionnaire echoed that altruism and the prospect of scientific discovery are increasingly important motivators with advancing age, whereas financial incentives become less important. Older adults have more free time to participate, are less deterred by the prospect of pain, and express more trust in researchers than younger people. Attitudes towards different imaging methods (MRI, EEG, NIBS and Eye tracking) varied, with fewest negative emotions for eye-tracking and most for non-invasive brain stimulation, but positive attitudes generally increased and negative attitudes reduced with age. These findings highlight the importance of tailoring recruitment strategies to different age groups to enhance diversity in cognitive neuroscience research. Improving communication, addressing practical barriers, and framing studies in a meaningful context may help increase participation among groups who are traditionally underrepresented in neuroimaging research.",2025-09-04T10:28:17.269133,"Aging,Cognitive Neuroscience,EDI,Neuroimaging,Widening participation",,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/u9jbk_v1/,,psyarxiv
t7vks_v1,Negative Emotion Recognition Impairments Despite Preserved Neural Activity in Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI),"Being able to interpret emotional expressions is fundamental to social interaction. Although 
deficits in emotion recognition are well-documented in dementia, they have received less 
attention in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Due to the overlap in neural processes supporting 
emotion and cognition, early disruptions in emotion recognition may indicate broader functional 
decline. This study examined behavioral and neural responses to emotional faces in patients with 
MCI using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm. For that aim, N=60 
participants were recruited, including 30 patients with MCI and 30 healthy controls. During fMRI, 
participants completed a facial emotion recognition task with expressions of anger, fear, sadness, 
happiness, and neutral faces. Behavioral assessments further included measures of cognitive 
domains (attention, memory, executive functioning, language, visuospatial skills), face 
processing, emotional intelligence, and emotional interference. Patients with MCI showed 
impaired recognition of negative emotions, such as anger (β=–0.37, p&lt;0.05), fear (β=–0.37, 
p&lt;0.05), and sadness (β=–0.85, p&lt;0.001), whereas recognition of happiness remained intact. 
Sadness recognition was predicted by face processing ability, and overall emotion recognition was 
associated with memory performance. fMRI results showed widespread, emotion-specific 
activation in healthy controls, particularly in occipital, frontal, and subcortical regions. Patients 
with MCI showed reduced activation and less differentiated patterns, though group-level BOLD 
differences were not statistically significant. In summary, patients with MCI demonstrated 
difficulties in recognizing negative emotions, which may impact social functioning, while neural 
mechanisms supporting emotion recognition appear largely preserved at this stage of cognitive 
decline.",2025-09-03T19:22:06.095968,,,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/t7vks_v1/,,psyarxiv
c7v93_v1,Unravelling attachment – A network analysis of the cognitive pathways linking attachment and prolonged grief,"Background
Attachment style is widely recognised as influential in shaping responses to bereavement and prolonged grief disorder (PGD). Although theorised extensively, empirical clarity regarding how attachment styles specifically impact PGD symptoms and therapeutic implications remains limited. This study aimed to identify cognitive-behavioural mechanisms linking attachment styles to PGD symptoms.
Methods
Data were collected from a community sample of 695 bereaved adults. Network analysis explored interactions between attachment styles (anxious and avoidant) and various cognitive-behavioural factors associated with PGD, including appraisals, memory characteristics, maladaptive coping strategies, and social disconnection.
Results
The findings reveal attachment styles as peripheral within the network, suggesting that their direct influence on PGD symptoms may be less central than previously theorised. However, anxious attachment correlated positively with injustice rumination and altered social self, while avoidant attachment was positively associated with perceived loss of future and relationships and preferences for solitude, and negatively associated with proximity-seeking behaviours and fear of losing connection to the deceased. Cognitive-behavioural factors, particularly memory characteristics and social disconnection, held central positions within the network, mediating relationships between attachment styles and PGD.
Conclusions
Attachment styles indirectly influence PGD through cognitive-behavioural pathways rather than exerting strong direct effects. By bridging the gap between attachment theory and cognitive-behavioural approaches to grief, this study offers a more nuanced understanding of its relationship with PGD, and points towards potential new avenues for future interventions aimed at addressing attachment-related challenges in bereaved individuals.",2025-09-02T18:09:50.236341,,,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/c7v93_v1/,,psyarxiv
6tqev_v2,From vectors to symbols to cognition: The symbolic and sub-symbolic aspects of vector-symbolic cognitive models,"To achieve a full, theoretical understanding of a cognitive process, explanations of the process need to be provided at both symbolic (i.e., representational) and sub-symbolic levels of description. We argue that cognitive models implemented in vector-symbolic architectures (VSAs) intrinsically operate at both of levels and thus provide a needed bridge. We characterize the sub-symbolic level of VSAs in terms of a small set of linear algebra operations. We characterize the symbolic level of VSAs in terms of cognitive processes, in particular how information is represented, stored, and retrieved, and classify vector-symbolic cognitive models in the literature according to their implementation of these processes. On the basis of our analysis, we speculate on avenues for future research, and suggest means for theoretical unification of existent models.",2025-09-02T00:46:28.260266,"cognitive modelling,cognitive models,computational models,holographic reduced representations,human memory,literature review,sub-symbolic modelling,symbolic modelling,vector symbolic architectures",,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/6tqev_v2/,,psyarxiv

zc5bx_v1,Adaptive Regulation of Confidence Following Metacognitive Conflict: Evidence from Behavior and Computational Modeling,"It is well established that external feedback is effective not only for enhancing cognitive performance but also for regulating metacognitive monitoring. However, external feedback could be detrimental when it conflicts with one’s internal feedback signal (i.e. the level of confidence we have in our decisions). Currently, however, it is unknown how discrepancies between internal and external feedback (“metacognitive conflict”) influence cognitive and metacognitive performance. Here, we examined this question in a series of perceptual decision-making experiments in which participants reported both their level of confidence and received performance feedback. Metacognitive conflict occurs if participants have high confidence in their decision, but external feedback indicates that the decision was erroneous, or vice versa. Results revealed that metacognitive conflict triggers next-trial behavioral adjustments: participants exhibit significantly lower confidence following metacognitive conflict. Critically, this adaptation effect was confined to the trial level, with no sustained modulation observed when manipulating metacognitive conflict at the block level. To better characterize the computational mechanisms underlying this effect, we deployed an evidence accumulation model with additional post-decision accumulation to quantify confidence. Model fits revealed that participants become more conservative in reporting confidence after experiencing metacognitive conflict, as evidenced by biased post-decision starting points. Jointly, our findings provide much needed insight into the metacognitive consequences of metacognitive conflict.",2025-09-02T01:15:09.578599,,,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/zc5bx_v1/,,psyarxiv
zsh6u_v1,Small-World Minds Create the Illusion of Low-Dimensional Social Cognition Under Constrained Stimuli,"A long-standing tradition suggests that social inferences are summarized by a few dimensions (e.g., warmth, competence). However, such findings relied on constrained stimuli (e.g., group labels, static faces). Studies using naturalistic designs instead reveal high dimensionality. We propose a new perspective that reconciles these views: mental representations of social inferences are structured as a growing network with small-world properties. In this structure, nodes (social inferences) are connected with only a few steps from one another, so even limited activation—elicited by constrained stimuli in only a small subset of nodes—propagates broadly across the network, producing covariation that mimics low-dimensional structures. However, these dimensions are not functional but emergent properties of network dynamics under constrained input. We demonstrated how this small-world-minds perspective accounts for classic phenomena—halo effect and psychological dimensions—as artifacts of stimulus limitations. We call for moving beyond low-dimensional paradigms to understand the complexity of social cognition.",2025-09-02T02:16:13.869995,"computational modeling,impression formation,network science,person perception,social cognition",,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/zsh6u_v1/,,psyarxiv
vq3hx_v1,REM Sleep as a Cognitive and Emotional Simulator for Decision-Making under Uncertainty: A Hypothesis/Theoretical Framework,"In a dynamic and uncertain world, the human brain must efficiently process emotions and simulate potential scenarios to enhance decision-making under ambiguity. This theoretical framework proposes that rapid eye movement (REM) sleep serves as a cognitive simulator, decoding unconscious emotions and incoming information within a safe, virtual environment. During REM sleep, limbic system structures, such as the amygdala, hippocampus, and insula, integrate recent sensory inputs with long-term memory schemas, transforming raw emotional signals based on potential threats and rewards into actionable insights. Simultaneously, REM sleep facilitates affect-centric probabilistic simulations through hippocampal-prefrontal interactions, generating symbolic reconstructions of past experiences and hypothetical scenarios to foster cognitive flexibility and resilience. This model extends traditional perspectives on REM sleep, which emphasize memory consolidation and emotional regulation, by highlighting its critical role in future-oriented decision-making. Drawing on insights from neuroscience, psychology, and computational analogies with artificial intelligence, this framework highlights the dual function of REM sleep in emotional familiarization and adaptive strategy rehearsal. Recent evidence from studies on sleep deprivation and REM-specific manipulations further supports this, showing impairments in decision-making, insight generation, and risk assessment when REM is disrupted. Empirical gaps, including the need for direct neurobehavioral evidence linking REM to specific decision-making outcomes, and alternative hypotheses, such as the role of non-REM sleep or slow-wave activity, are discussed to contextualize the contributions of the model and guide future interdisciplinary research.",2025-08-31T14:08:41.155711,,,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/vq3hx_v1/,,psyarxiv
jmrtf_v1,A Dharmakīrtian Model of Relevance Realization in Cognitive Agents,"A fundamental problem facing any learning organism is how to determine which aspects of its experience to attend to and which to ignore when guiding its goal-oriented actions. This problem, known as relevance realization, is key to understanding how cognitive agents, biological or artificial, learn purposeful behaviors through experience-based interactions with their environment. However, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of how organisms solve the relevance realization problem is currently lacking. Here, we approach this challenge by proposing a synthesis between a contemporary computational framework of goal-oriented learning in cognitive agents and a canonical Buddhist account of concept formation, specifically as developed by the Indian philosopher Dharmakīrti (c. 6-7th century C.E.). Our approach posits that cognitive agents form goal-dependent conceptual representations of the world that reflect subjective preferences about properties of simulated sensorimotor experience streams. By drawing on Dharmakīrti’s ideas to inform computational models of goal-directed learning, our approach bears on current debates regarding the prerequisites for and implications of artificially emulating human-like cognition.",2025-08-31T14:12:27.292500,,,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/jmrtf_v1/,,psyarxiv
