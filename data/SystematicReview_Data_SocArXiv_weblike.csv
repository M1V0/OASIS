E00DE-553-398,Sexualization of Children in Deepfakes and Hentai: Examining Reddit User Views,"Based on a large dataset (N=13293) of Reddit comments collected on the topic, this article takes a qualitative approach to examine Reddit users’ views and attitudes about the sexualization of minors (SOM) in deepfakes and hentai. The analysis captured five major themes in the discussion over SOM: illegality, art, promoting pedophilia, increase in offending and general harmfulness. Furthermore, the discussion was underscored by the central question of who is a minor, which feeds the already problematic definitional ambiguity and keeps the perceived discursive boundaries of the illegality of SOM in flux. Current study adds to the existing literature by presenting information that could be useful in designing prevention and awareness efforts addressing SOM and CSAM, particularly to the general public.",2021-03-25T10:02:22.724253+00:00,"deepfake,csa,qualitative,deep-fake,reddit,sexualization of minors,child sexual abuse material,hentai,sexualization,child sexual abuse,child sexual exploitation",,,Simone Eelmaa,socarxiv
E0133-715-583,The Liar’s Dividend: Can Politicians Use Deepfakes and Fake News to Evade Accountability?,"This study addresses the phenomenon of misinformation about misinformation, or politicians ""crying wolf"" over fake news. Strategic and false allegations that stories are fake news or deepfakes may benefit politicians by helping them maintain support in the face of information damaging to their reputation. We posit that this concept, known as the ""liar's dividend,"" works through two theoretical channels: by invoking informational uncertainty or by encouraging oppositional rallying of core supporters. To evaluate the implications of the liar's dividend, we use three survey experiments detailing hypothetical politician responses to video or text news stories depicting real politician scandals. We find that allegations of misinformation raise politician support, while potentially undermining trust in media. Moreover, these false claims produce greater dividends for politicians than longstanding alternative responses to scandal, such as remaining silent or apologizing. Finally, false allegations of misinformation pay off less for videos (""deepfakes"") than text stories (""fake news"").",2022-05-11T02:35:03.803402+00:00,"deepfake,fake news,survey experiment,misinformation,media,trust",,,"Natalia Bueno, Kaylyn Jackson Schiff, Daniel S.

E004F-D30-BF1,The Imitation Game: Examining Regulatory Challenges of Political Deepfakes in the European Union,"The global impact of deepfake technology is becoming increasingly evident everywhere around the world, including in the European Union. The worrisome consequences of deepfake technology extend not only to the film and entertainment industry but also within the political sphere. Such development could contribute to the further erosion of truth and trust, which weaken core democratic functions and norms. Against this backdrop, this dissertation aims to answer the following research question: how should political deepfakes be regulated in the EU? In conclusion, this dissertation reveals four distinct conclusions regarding the implications of political deepfakes on democracy and fundamental rights, as well as the inadequacies of existing regulations in addressing the associated challenges within the EU.",2024-04-06T12:52:25.971221+00:00,"ai act,gdpr,political deepfake,dsa,eu",,,Alia Yofira Karunian,socarxiv
E01C2-977-EDB,Individual Attitudes Toward Deepfakes of Deceased Artists,"This exploratory qualitative study uses a multilevel framework, combining the Social Construction of Technology and the Cognitive-Affective-Normative model, to examine how individual perceptions, emotions, and reflections shape deepfake acceptance, particularly those featuring deceased artists. Fifty-one participants (70.37% female; Mean Age = 24.6) took part in six online focus groups, viewing two randomly selected deepfakes of deceased artists. Thematic analysis, using a phenomenological approach, identified primarily intellectual reactions, with two key layers: first-order evaluations of realism and second-order societal impact assessments. These impacts spanned micro (individuals), meso (content creators/distributors), and macro (society-wide) levels. While cognitive and ethical concerns were prominent, emotional responses were fewer, often expressing discomfort or surprise. Findings offer valuable insights for the digital media industry and regulators in understanding public reception of deepfake technology.",2024-11-11T21:40:11.493048+00:00,"social construction of technology,fake content,digital resurrection,deceased artists,attitudes toward technology,artist revival,technology acceptance,deepfakes,attitudes",,,"María T.

E0053-DCE-F0D,Moral intuitions behind deepfake-related discussions in Reddit communities,"Deepfakes are AI-synthesized content that are becoming popular on many social media platforms, meaning the use of deepfakes is increasing in society, regardless of its societal implications. Its implications are harmful if the moral intuitions behind deepfakes are problematic; thus, it is important to explore how the moral intuitions behind deepfakes unfold in communities at scale. However, understanding perceived moral viewpoints unfolding in digital contexts is challenging, due to the complexities in conversations. In this research, we demonstrate how Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) can be used as a lens through which to operationalize moral viewpoints in discussions about deepfakes on Reddit communities. Using the extended Moral Foundations Dictionary (eMFD), we measured the strengths of moral intuition (moral loading) behind 101,869 Reddit posts. We present the discussions that unfolded on Reddit in 2018–2022 wherein intuitions behind some posts were found to be morally questionable to society. Our results may help platforms detect and take action against immoral activities related to deepfakes.",2023-03-04T14:14:24.589268+00:00,"moral foundation theory,deepfake discussions,discourse analysis,reddit,deepfakes,communities,moral intuitions",,,"Hariharan Raveenthiran, Dilrukshi Gamage, Kazutoshi Sasahara",socarxiv
E0120-4F6-C66,Individual Variables Predicting Responses to Deepfakes: A Cross-Cultural Contrast.,"This study examines the impact of the Big Five personality traits, need for cognition (NFC), and need for affect (NFA) on responses to deepfakes across different genres (entertainment, political, and cheapfakes). Data from 1554 participants in Spain (n = 782) and the United States (n = 772) were analyzed regarding narrative transportation, realism, identification, enjoyment, and parasocial interaction. The findings suggest that extraversion, conscientiousness, and agreeableness positively influence emotional and cognitive engagement with deepfakes, whereas neuroticism reduces enjoyment and connection. NFC enhances engagement with complex content, particularly in political deepfakes, whereas NFA strengthens emotional engagement, especially in entertainment deepfakes. U.S. participants exhibit higher cognitive and emotional responses than their Spanish counterparts, suggesting that cultural context moderates the impact of individual variables. These findings highlight the interplay between personality traits, NFC, and NFA in shaping deepfake reception, and emphasize the need to consider cultural factors in future research.",2025-05-20,"Deepfakes, personality traits, need for cognition, need for affect, enjoyment, identification with characters, narrative transportation, parasocial interaction, perceived realism, cross-cultural.",,,"María T.

E0091-D1F-AB6,Weaponization of the Social Sciences and Strategic Reconstruction of the National Academic System: A Policy Proposal,"This study aims to explore the potential role and pathways for transforming social sciences within the national security and strategic competition landscape. Its objectives address pressing challenges including the inadequate alignment between social sciences and national strategy, insufficient conversion of academic findings into policy and practical tools, intensifying disinformation offensives and countermeasures, and uneven allocation of research resources. Methodologically, this study combines strategic intelligence analysis with policy evaluation, employing comparative case studies, interdisciplinary literature reviews, and institutional design frameworks. It draws upon the DARPA ‘Heilmeier Eight Questions’ and the EU's mission-oriented innovation model for its arguments. Findings indicate that by establishing a national-level social science research platform, optimising research funding mechanisms, fostering closer alignment between academic pursuits and strategic imperatives, and developing deepfake forensics alongside cognitive immunity systems, social sciences may evolve from traditional knowledge accumulation into resources serving strategic decision-making and cognitive competition. This transformative trajectory enhances political narrative power and cognitive dominance, bolsters institutional adaptability, and furnishes nations with combined soft and hard competitive advantages on the international stage. The conclusion posits that the strategic utilisation of social sciences is not a singular pathway but a multi-layered, multi-stage exploratory process, offering significant reference value for enhancing national security and international influence.",2025-09-07,,,,WEI MENG,socarxiv
