E0014-E1F-F16,The prevalence of child sexual abuse among Slovak late adolescents,"The present study aimed to assess the prevalence and characteristics of child sexual abuse (CSA) in a nationally-representative sample of Slovak late adolescents. Randomized cluster sampling plan was used to sample 2186 secondary school students in their final school year with mean age of 18.6 years (SD = 0.7 years). The study employed the Child Sexual Abuse Questionnaire (Mohler-Kuo et al., 2014) consisting of multiple behavior-specific questions. The prevalence of CSA was analyzed separately for three clusters of CSA and gender. The self-reported lifetime prevalence of at least one form of CSA was 47.3% among girls and 22.0% among boys. The prevalence of noncontact forms of CSA was 40.6% among girls and 17.7% among boys. CSA with physical contact without penetration was reported by 30.2% girls and 11.6% boys. The prevalence of CSA with penetration was 5.6% among girls and 1.3% among boys. More than half of CSA occurred between 16-18 year of age in all three CSA cluster types. The severity of abuse was positively associated with the acquaintance with the perpetrator. Roughly 43-56% disclosed the abuse to another person. The majority of disclosed CSA was revealed to peers and partners. Negligible proportion of CSA instances were reported to the police. The results show that CSA is a widespread and considerably covert phenomenon within the population of Slovak late adolescents. Prevention activities should consider broad spectrum of CSA forms in order to counteract tendencies to associate CSA only with unwanted sexual intercourse.",2018-03-25T20:25:55.821395+00:00,"disclosure,late adolescence,child sexual abuse,prevalence",,,"Slávka Karkošková, Ivan Ropovik",socarxiv

E010B-623-982,"The new mothers’ little helpers: medicalization, victimization, and criminalization of motherhood via prescription drugs","In order to understand the relationship between nonmedical prescription drug use, gender, and crime, interviews were conducted with 40 incarcerated women who self-identified as nonmedical Rx users. Of the women we interviewed, 70% were prescribed Rx drugs from their doctors to aid in recovery from cesarean section childbirth deliveries, treat postpartum depression, or for mental or physical health problems associated with childhood abuse and victimization. These women subsequently discovered that these pills also helped them cope with the stresses of caretaking and keeping the family together, particularly when experiencing intimate partner violence and prolonged poverty. Women were motivated to use Rx drugs in order to be a “good” mother, as defined by medical and cultural discourse; however, despite positive intentions, prolonged nonmedical use often hindered the realization of these ideals and ultimately resulted in their criminalization, incarceration, and separation from their children.",2018-04-11T19:51:40.026419+00:00,,,,"Jennifer Gatewood Owens, Michelle Smirnova",socarxiv
E00CD-75B-094,"Coercive control: Patterns in crimes, arrests and outcomes for a new domestic abuse offence","Critics of the criminalisation of coercive control warned that the criminal justice system was ill-prepared for a conceptualisation of domestic abuse that relies on victim accounts of fear and manipulation rather than on evidence of violence. Using data obtained through freedom of information requests to police forces and aggregated police records, this paper presents police force-level and nationwide patterns in recorded crimes, police arrests and crime outcomes for this new crime and shows that, nationally, the number of recorded crimes and arrests rose steadily, but there was significant variation in these patterns between police forces. Analysing police outcomes, we demonstrate that coercive control crimes face greater evidential challenges and are far less likely to result in prosecution than domestic abuse crimes in general. We discuss their implications of these trends and findings for the policing and criminalisation of coercive control.",2021-03-11T13:18:14.801881+00:00,"coercive control,domestic abuse,policing",,,"Iain Brennan, Andy Myhill",socarxiv

Findings indicate that heterosexual/straight women abused by women and bisexual women abused by women are significantly more likely to report current difficulty sleeping, while heterosexual/straight women abused by women and bisexual women abused by men are more likely to self-rate their overall mental health as poor (versus good or excellent). This is the first study using population-based data that takes into account all forms of violence and its impact on sexually diverse women—when we include psychological abuse and controlling tactics, the impact on mental health is worse than previously noted: around 80-90% of all women experience some form of anxiety, depression, intense fear, restlessness, nightmares, or stressors that impact their ability to work, go to school, and complete daily life activities.",2018-02-16T16:32:15.202763+00:00,"bisexual,health,trauma,lgbtq,mental health,bisexuality,domestic violence,intimate partner violence,lgbt",,,Bethany M Coston,socarxiv
E0170-BED-E0A,Ending Abuse of Patent Continuations,"One of the oddest things to an outsider about the United States patent system is that due to continuation practice it is impossible for the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) ever to finally reject a patent application. Continuation applications have led to abuse of the patent prosecution process. They serve very little useful purpose, and what benefits they confer may be outweighed by their potential for mischief. In an effort to study the pervasiveness of continuation practice, we compiled an original dataset comprising 2,224,379 patents, every patent issued from 1976 through 2000. We found that while continuations are filed in 23% of all patent applications, patents based on continuation applications represent 52% of all litigated patents. Although continuations are used in a minority of all patents, it is the most important minority because it is the minority most likely to end up in litigation. We examine the efforts undertaken to control the problems associated with continuation patents (changing the patent term, publishing applications, prosecution laches) and find them insufficient. The world would probably be a better place if they were abolished. Recognizing, however, that the abuse of continuation practice is not as pervasive as some might think, we propose a number of means by which Congress and the courts could strengthen existing rules designed to limit their abuse while preserving the practice. At a minimum, the empirical data we present can provide litigants and judges with a baseline for assessing the reasonableness of delay caused by the filing of multiple continuations by the patentee in determining the applicability of equitable remedies such as prosecution laches.",2016-08-23T22:10:22.667000+00:00,"socarxiv,preprint",,,Mark Lemley,socarxiv
E014B-8F8-54C,Is the Patent Office a Rubber Stamp?,"A growing chorus of voices is sounding a common refrain - the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) is issuing far too many bad patents. These criticisms are complicated by the rather surprising fact that we don't actually know what percentage of patent applications actually issue as patents. In this paper, we use a novel dataset of all published patent applications filed in January 2001 to estimate the grant rate. These data also allow us to examine the uses of continuation applications, and to assess dynamics of applicant-examiner interaction over the patent prosecution process. We find that the PTO rejects a surprisingly high percentage of patents. While more than two-thirds of all applications result in at least one patent, a significant number of applications are rejected and then finally abandoned by the applicant. We also find that the likelihood of obtaining a patent varies significantly by industry, but in surprising ways. Finally, despite a variety of reforms that might be thought to reduce the use and abuse of continuation applications, we find a high use of continuation applications of various types.",2016-08-24T21:19:52.887000+00:00,"preprint,socarxiv",,,Mark Lemley,socarxiv
E00A0-BE0-192,"Brief Amici Curiae of Experts in the History of Executive Surveillance: James Bamford, Loch Johnson, and Peter Fenn in First Unitarian Church of Los Angeles v. National Security Agency","*Abstract: * This case presents pressing questions regarding the executive's power to collect, store, and use Americans' telephony and other personal data for the purposes of conducting surveillance operations. In the wake of recent disclosures revealing National Security Agency data collection programs, the First Unitarian Church of Los Angeles and 21 other membership and political advocacy organizations filed this lawsuit to challenge the NSA's collection of telephony data as an infringement of their members' First and Fourth Amendment rights. In this amicus brief, experts in the history of American surveillance -- James Bamford, author of The Puzzle Palace; Peter Fenn, who served as Washington Chief of Staff for Senator Frank Church and as a staff member to the Senate Intelligence Committee; and Dr. Loch Johnson, who served as special assistant to the Church Committee chair and as staff director of the House Subcommittee on Intelligence Oversight -- explain the historical parallels between the executive surveillance programs that are presently coming to light and the development of abusive surveillance practices from the 1940s to the 1970s. All amici were directly involved in the comprehensive review of twentieth-century American intelligence operations completed by the Church Committee in the 1970s, giving them a uniquely thorough understanding of these parallels. Drawing from the experts’ extensive knowledge, the brief explains the clear parallels between the development and growth of the abusive practices of the mid-twentieth century -- when American intelligence agencies helped conduct politically motivated surveillance of Americans ranging from ordinary teachers, journalists and peace activists to civil rights leaders, members of Congress, and a Supreme Court justice -- and today’s vast surveillance programs. History shows that abusive surveillance does not require bad actors to grow and flourish: instead, it is the natural outgrowth of too much secrecy and too little oversight by other branches of government. In light of this clear historical pattern, the brief argues that the court should carefully apply existing legal limits on the government’s surveillance powers to address the risks posed by the executive branch and the intelligence agencies’ claims to expansive power to determine the limits of their own activities.

E0141-36F-EAE,"Copyright Trolling, An Empirical Study, 100 Iowa Law Review 1105-1146 (2015)","This empirical and doctrinal study of copyright trolling presents new data showing the astonishing rate of growth of multi-defendant John Doe litigation in United States district courts over the past decade. It also presents new evidence of the association between this form of litigation and allegations of infringement concerning pornographic films. Multi-defendant John Doe lawsuits have become the most common form of copyright litigation in several U.S. districts, and in districts such as the Northern District of Illinois, copyright litigation involving pornography accounts for more than half of new cases. This Article highlights a fundamental oversight in the literature on copyright trolls. Paralleling discussions in patent law, scholars addressing the troll issue in copyright have applied status-based definitions to determine who is, and is not, a troll. This Article argues that the definition should be conduct-based. Multi-defendant John Doe litigation should be considered copyright trolling whenever it is motivated by a desire to turn litigation into an independent revenue stream. Such litigation, when initiated with the aim of turning a profit in the courthouse as opposed to seeking compensation or deterring illegal activity, reflects a kind of systematic opportunism that fits squarely within the concept of litigation trolling. This Article shows that existing status-based definitions of copyright trolls do not account for what is now arguably the most prevalent form of trolling. In addition to these empirical and theoretical contributions, this Article shows how statutory damages and permissive joinder make multi-defendant John Doe litigation possible and why allegations of infringement concerning pornographic films are particularly well-suited to this model.",2016-07-27T20:24:04.567000+00:00,"statutory damages,copyright trolling,trolls,litigation,socarxiv,copyright,preprint,abuse",,,Matthew Sag,socarxiv
E008F-AFC-66C,Anti-Circumvention Misuse,"The anticircumvention provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act penalize both the circumvention of technical protection measures, and supplying the means for such circumvention. These prohibitions are entirely separate from the exclusive rights under copyright, causing some commentators to dub the anti-circumvention right as ""paracopyright."" Such ""paracopyright"" effectively grants copyright holders sweeping new ability to impose terms of access on content users: consumers who access content without accepting the content owner's terms would violate the owner's ""paracopyright"" even if the material accessed is not itself copyrighted or copyrightable. At some point, such leveraging of access control seems certain to overstep the bounds militated by sound policy or intended by Congress. In the past, abuse of intellectual property rights has been curtailed under the doctrine of misuse. Misuse claims first arose in the patent context, where the patent might be leveraged into licensing terms that exceeded the proper scope of the patent grant. More recently, overreaching in copyright licensing has been recognized to constitute a form of misuse. This paper argues that because DMCA ""paracopyright"" is ripe for abuse, limits on overreaching may be imposed by applying the misuse doctrine in this new area. Just as improper leveraging of patent and copyright may be curtailed by application of the misuse doctrine, so improper leveraging of paracopyright should be curtailed by application of misuse. This new application of misuse doctrine may be guided by the standards established in previous applications to patent and copyright law, and may serve a similar function in regulating the excesses invited by the anticircumvention right.",2016-07-16T19:02:34.087000+00:00,"preprint,technical protection measures,paracopyright,dmca,tpm,copyright,socarxiv,digital rights management,drm",,,Dan Burk,socarxiv
E012C-85F-172,"Intellectuals, Politicians, and the Public in Chinua Achebe’s A Man of the People: A Postcolonial Critique","This paper sheds light on the possible hope for the Nigerian situation in Chinua Achebe’s A Man of the People (1966), away from bankrupt intellectuals, corrupt politicians, and an ignorant public. This novel portrays two schools of ineffectual native educators who seem to be antagonists: the traditional old school and the new modern intellectuals. Postcolonial/race theories of Fanon, Appiah, Du Bois, and Woodson as well as Gramsci’s notion of the “organic intellectual” are employed to get a clearer image of the role of intellectuals and politicians in shaping the future of a country in the post-independence era. The article concludes that intellectuals with European education may contribute to the corruption of their country due to reasons like divided loyalties, miseducation, and lack of communication with the public. Additionally, Achebe is critical of the current politicians and the excluded public. So, our analysis employs Woodson’s concept of “the miseducation of the Negro” because such “miseducation” produces incompetent politicians like Chief Nanga, weak intellectuals like Odili Samalu, and ignorant people like the public in the novel. Real hope against governmental corruption in Achebe's satirical novel can be found in integrating the class of intellectual/political leaders and the public and in a different kind of indoctrination, neither colonial nor neo-colonial. The truly educated class and the “organic intellectuals” produced from the public are key solutions for a better ""Nigeria."" Hence, this article highlights the role of politicized education in post-independence nation building and tackles the mishaps of nascent nationalism.",2017-03-17T05:06:23.877000+00:00,"the public,postcolonialism,chinua achebe,politics,intellectuals",,,"Shadi Saleh Ahmad Neimneh, AWEJ for Translation &amp; Literary Studies, Amneh Khaleel Hussein Abussamen",socarxiv
E0219-E09-2D8,Understanding the Financial Knowledge Gap: A New Dimension of Inequality in Later Life,"To understand the relationship between financial knowledge and financial behaviors, it is important to understand the financial knowledge gap – the distance between objectively and subjectively measured financial knowledge. Overestimating one’s financial knowledge can lead to risky financial behaviors and economic vulnerability. To date, limited empirical work has examined how the gap between one’s perception of their own financial knowledge and their actual knowledge varies across the life course. We analyze the size and nature of the financial knowledge gap and its variation across the life course. We use nationally representative data from the Canadian Financial Capability Survey (CFCS) and find robust evidence that older adults overestimate their financial knowledge. Social workers can assess the financial knowledge gap and inform and educate their clients to protect from financial fraud, exploitation, and, abuse. Furthermore, social workers can offer informational seminars, workshops, and financial planning and counseling sessions.",2016-12-12T22:34:17.799000+00:00,"financial capability,canada,financial knowledge,life course,older adults,financial knowledge gap",,,"Mohammad Nuruzzaman Khan, Katrina Cherney, David W.

E00FE-CF7-B21,Reducing Digital Copyright Infringement Without Restricting Innovation,"Suing actual infringers is passe in copyright law. In the digital environment, the real stakes lie in suing those who facilitate infringement by others. There is of course a good reason copyright owners are filing such suits. They see themselves as under threat from a flood of cheap, easy copies and a dramatic increase in the number of people who can make those copies. The high volume of illegal uses, and the low return to suing any individual, make it more cost-effective to aim as far up the chain as possible. From the perspective of the movie industry, it's easier and more effective to shut down Napster than to sue the millions of people who traded files illegally on Napster. So far, the courts have been willing to go along, shutting down a number of innovative services in the digital music realm. In this article, we argue that unrestricted liability for anyone who is in any way involved with copyright infringement is a bad idea. Indirect liability is a continuum, in which acts most closely related to infringement and with the fewest affirmative benefits are the easiest to condemn. Going after makers of technology for the uses to which their technologies may be put threatens to stifle innovation. The fundamental difficulty is that while courts can make decisions about direct infringement on a case-by-case basis, lawsuits based on indirect liability necessarily sweep together both socially beneficial and socially harmful uses of a program or service, either permitting both uses or condemning both. Optimal digital copyright policy would do two things: stop deterring innovators, and permit cost-effective enforcement of copyright in the digital environment. In this paper, we suggest at least two possible alternatives that might provide ways out of the digital copyright morass. Both alternatives stem from the basic economics of copyright enforcement. It is not currently cost-effective for copyright owners to sue individual infringers, because there are tens of millions of them, because lawsuits are expensive, and because each infringer would be liable only for minimal damages. They are happy to sue facilitators instead, because there are fewer of them and both damages and the benefits of injunctive relief are substantial. Copyright owners have no incentive to permit optimal innovation by facilitators, because they do not benefit from that innovation except indirectly. Individual infringers in turn have no incentive to change their behavior or to subscribe to fee-based services, because they suffer none of the costs of infringement. One solution is to change the incentives of individuals. Because individual users of peer-to-peer (p2p) networks know that it is extremely unlikely they will be sued, economic theory suggests that the only way to effectively deter infringement is to increase the effective sanction substantially for those who are caught. Were the government to begin criminally prosecuting selected users of peer-to-peer services - or were the RIAA to sue end users in earnest - it could have a substantial deterrent effect on many illegal users. Selective prosecution has other advantages as well - the government could target the relatively few keystone providers of illegal files on p2p sites, and those are precisely the users who are least likely to be engaged in fair use. While particular prosecutions won't stop illegal file trading altogether, copyright owners have never been able to prevent all piracy. All they need to do is reduce piracy enough that they can make a return on their investment. Another solution is to change the incentives of copyright owners to sue individual infringers by reducing the cost of such a suit. One such approach would be a levy system. Levies on equipment or services have the virtue of permitting automatic collection of royalties, reducing the enforcement cost dramatically, but at the cost of taxing legal as well as illegal uses. A levy solves the enforcement problem at the front end, but it is similar in many ways to the current approach of suing facilitators. The main difference is that under a levy system the copyright owner is protected by a compulsory license rather than a property rule. An alternative proposal to reduce the cost of enforcement is to create some sort of quick, cheap arbitration system that enables copyright owners to get some limited relief against abusers of p2p systems. The existing domain name trademark arbitration system is a model in some respects - its speed and low cost - but a cautionary tale in others - its lack of process protections. Such a system would permit low-cost enforcement of copyright infringement against direct infringers, reducing the need for content owners to sue facilitators. Relative to levies, an arbitration system would trade off some increase in cost for accuracy, targeting only those making illegal uses rather than all users of computers or p2p networks. It would be fairer than selective criminal prosecution, because the burden would fall more evenly on each wrongdoer, rather than imposing stark punishment on a few in order to serve society's interest in deterring the rest. The system could also be designed to improve accuracy relative to the binary choice the courts face in indirect infringement cases today. We could design the system so that it is limited to clear cases. We could also build in a defense for arguable fair uses, so that a user who could prove they were space-shifting CDs they already own would have a defense.",2016-08-23T18:40:41.074000+00:00,"preprint,socarxiv",,,Mark Lemley,socarxiv
E01A5-FE2-CC5,Missing the Forest for the Trolls,"Trolls are a significant feature of the patent system. They account for a large number of suits, now a majority of all patent assertions in the country and an even higher percentage in the information technology (IT) industries. They win both larger judgments and larger settlements than do “practicing entities” (“PEs”) -- those that practice patents and are not principally in the business of collecting money from others that practice them. And they do so despite complaints that trolls assert weak patents and some evidence that troll patents are more likely to lose in court. Nonetheless, we think the focus on patent trolls obscures a more complex set of challenges confronting the patent system. In this paper, we make three points. First, patent trolls are not a unitary phenomenon. We see at least three different troll business models developing, and those models have different effects on the patent system. Second, patent assertions by practicing entities can create just as many problems as assertions by patent trolls. The nature of many industries obscures some of the costs of those assertions, but that does not mean they are cost-free. In addition, practicing entities are increasingly engaging in “patent privateering,” in which product-producing companies take on many of the attributes of trolls. Put differently, while trolls exploit problems with the patent system, they are not the only ones that do so. Third, many of the problems associated with trolls are in fact problems that stem from the disaggregation of complementary patents into too many different hands. That in turn suggests that groups like Intellectual Ventures might be reducing, not worsening, these problems (though, as we will see, the overall effects are ambiguous), while “patent privateers” that spin off patents in order for others to assert them might make things worse. For this reason, patent reformers and antitrust authorities should worry less about aggregation of patent rights and more about disaggregation of those rights, sometimes accomplished by spinning them out to others. Understanding the economics of patent assertions by both trolls and practicing entities allows us to move beyond labels and the search for “bad actors,” focusing instead on aspects of the patent system itself that give rise to the problems and on specific, objectionable conduct in which both trolls and practicing entities sometimes engage. Patent trolls alone are not the problem; they are a symptom of larger problems with the patent system. Treating the symptom will not solve the problems. In a very real sense, critics have been missing the forest for the trolls. Exposing the larger problems allows us to contemplate changes in patent law that will actually tackle the underlying pathologies of the patent system and the abusive conduct they enable.",2016-08-23T22:31:09.579000+00:00,"preprint,socarxiv",,,Mark Lemley,socarxiv
E0235-F8D-E5F,What the Right of Publicity Can Learn from Trademark Law,"The right of publicity gives people the right to control the use of their name and likeness for commercial purposes. For years, courts have struggled to make sense of two dimensions of this right - what it means to use a name or likeness commercially, and what aspect of a person's likeness are protected against appropriation. In the absence of any clear theoretical foundation for the right of publicity, the meanings of these terms have steadily swelled, to the point at which virtually any use that brings financial benefit to someone by referencing an individual qualifies as a violation of the right of publicity. At the same time, the courts have developed no meaningful counterweight to this ever-expanding right. Instead, they have created a few ad hoc exceptions in cases where the sweeping logic of the right of publicity seems to lead to results they consider unfair. Two types of publicity claims have raised particular problems for the courts. The first involves merchandising claims, in which individuals claim violation of their publicity right not by the use of a name in advertising, but by people who sell products that bear their name or likeness. Courts have generally resolved these claims by making a distinction between news or art, on the one hand, and merchandise, on the other - but as art and information become increasingly commodified, this distinction - if it ever made sense - has become ever harder to sustain. The second type of problematic claim involves cases in which a use draws attention away from the celebrity, or arguably sullies the celebrity's reputation in some way that harms the overall value of her identity. Properly limited, such a cause of action might have some theoretical appeal, but courts have applied it in ways that exceed any plausible theoretical justification, particularly when First Amendment considerations enter the fray. Perhaps ironically, one root of the problems with these cases lies in the very elusiveness of a theoretical justification for the right of publicity. When the government can clearly identify a purpose in limiting speech, courts have some basis on which to evaluate whether the speech limitation lives up to that purpose. But because the right of publicity rests upon a slough of sometimes sloppy rationalizations, courts have little way of determining whether a particular speech limitation is necessary or even appropriate in order to serve the law's normative goals. Instead, they appear to assume that the sum of a set of inadequate justifications equals far more than its parts, and allow right of publicity claims to run roughshod over the speech interests of the public. If the absence of a rationale has created the problem, then the answer lies in identifying whether and when a right of publicity might serve a legitimate government interest. Yet a review of the cases and literature reveals that no one seems to be able to explain exactly why individuals should have this right. A right of privacy can't justify it, for the right of publicity has been applied in a wide range of situations that don't implicate privacy at all. Some commentators have proposed a natural or moral right of control over one's name or likeness, but there seems no policy justification for giving such control, and the absence of such a right in most of the world and indeed throughout most of U.S. history should make us skeptical of claims based on some consensus moral belief. The moral claim to own uses of one's name also seems inconsistent with the absence of natural or moral rights justifications for other forms of intellectual property. Of late, and particularly in the merchandising and dilution-like cases, courts and commentators have turned to the incentive-based rationale underlying copyright law in search of both a justification for and limitations on the right of publicity. Reasoning that the right of publicity gives individuals the incentive to develop valuable personas, courts reason that depriving them of the fruits of their labors will interfere with those economic incentives. Some courts have even gone so far as to create a fair use doctrine, importing from copyright law judicially created limits on the enforcement of the right. This approach turns the right of publicity into a new form of intellectual property, one based explicitly on analogies to and justifications for real property. We think copyright is the wrong analogy. In the United States, copyright law is utilitarian. We grant copyrights in order to encourage the creation of new works of authorship. There is no similar justification for the right of publicity. Society doesn't need to encourage more celebrities, or more marketing of celebrity image. Nor is there any evidence that, even if such a result was desirable, a property-like right of publicity is well tailored to that goal. Copyright's fair use doctrine, moreover, involves tradeoffs between the interests of original creators and those who would like to make transformative uses of their creative works; the right of publicity has no similar tradeoff. Further, copyright's fair use doctrine is confusing to the point of incoherence; it is hardly a model anyone would wish to emulate. Finally, the analogy to copyright serves to obscure the important free speech interests at stake in right of publicity cases. For better or worse, copyright laws have gotten a free ride when it comes to the First Amendment; the copyright analogy may prompt courts to mistakenly extend that free ride to the right of publicity. The Lanham Act is a far more appropriate analogy to the right of publicity. The Lanham Act in its traditional form protects trademark owners against commercial uses of a trademark by others that are likely to confuse consumers, either as to the source of goods or as to the affiliation, endorsement, or sponsorship of those goods by the trademark owner. The right of publicity is designed at least in part to do the same thing for celebrities. It prevents companies from using the name or likeness of an individual in advertising or promotion to falsely suggest that the individual has endorsed the advertised product. More recently, the Lanham Act has been expanded to prevent dilution of famous trademarks by commercial uses that draw attention away from the trademark owner, or throw it into disrepute, even if they do not confuse. Dilution, too, has analogies in the right of publicity. Uses of a celebrity's name or likeness might in rare circumstances divert attention away from the celebrity or, more likely, might tarnish the reputation of the celebrity by using her name or likeness in a disreputable connection, even in the absence of confusion or assumptions of endorsement. Finally, a few courts have expanded trademark law to include a general right to control the merchandising of goods bearing a trademark, even in the absence of confusion or dilution. This merchandising right too has analogues in the right of publicity. Indeed, the mutation of the right of publicity into a virtually unlimited property right over any use of a name or likeness can best be understood as the wholesale adoption of the putative trademark merchandising right. Reconceiving the right of publicity as an outgrowth of trademark law has several significant benefits. First, it offers a helpful way to think about the different sorts of claims made under the rubric of publicity. We have considerable experience with each of these types of claims in trademark law, and applying that knowledge can help us understand why we might (or might not) want to prohibit particular uses, and when the law should forbid them. Most importantly, looking at the right of publicity through the lens of trademark law offers logical ways to limit the right of publicity. Trademarks are not property rights in the traditional sense, though a few commentators have argued that trademark owners should have property-like rights over their marks. The idea of a merchandising right, while recognized in a few cases and supported by trademark owners, is not commonly used to decide trademark cases. It is also a problematic concept, one that hardly deserves emulation. Trademark cases tend instead to be decided either based on likelihood of confusion or on dilution grounds. Both trademark infringement and dilution incorporate significant limiting principles designed to balance the interests of society against the interests of policy owners, and to accommodate First Amendment concerns. These limits have not been incorporated into the right of publicity, however. The result is a mutant version of trademark policy, including the affirmative rights but virtually none of the defenses or limits of trademark law. A proper understanding of the right of publicity would draw more completely on trademark principles, limiting the right to circumstances in which the use of an individual's name or likeness is either likely to confuse consumers or is likely to dilute the significance of a famous name. Revising the right of publicity to conform to the rules we have worked out in trademark cases will avoid some of the worst abuses of the right, limit the conflict between the right of publicity and First Amendment principles, and put the right on a more solid conceptual grounding. In Part I, we describe the growth of the right of publicity from its narrow privacy origins to a virtually unlimited, descendible, assignable property right. Part I discusses two particular excesses that this trend has brought about, and that are increasingly creating problems for the courts and the public: the expanding merchandising right, and the dilution-like cause of action. Part II discusses the existing efforts to explain the growth of the right of publicity. Those explanations have generally focused on incentive-based rationales akin to copyright law - rationales whose logic breaks down in the right of publicity context. Part II goes on to explain why copyright proves inadequate to justify or to delimit the right of publicity, with particular reference to the merchandising and dilution-like cases. In Part III, we offer a new explanation for the right of publicity, one based in trademark principles. Part III shows how the right of publicity has adopted some but not all of the rules of trademark law, and how a more complete importation of trademark principles into publicity law would solve many of the problems that plague the doctrine. Finally, in Part IV we consider some objections and compare our approach to alternative approaches for dealing with the problems of the publicity right.",2016-08-24T18:04:17.242000+00:00,"socarxiv,preprint",,,Mark Lemley,socarxiv
E0114-321-220,Antitrust Law and Regulatory Gaming,"Antitrust law promotes competition in the service of economic efficiency. Government regulation may or may not promote either competition or efficiency, depending on both the goals of the agency and the effects of industry ""capture."" Antitrust courts have long included regulated industries within their purview, working to ensure that regulated industries could not use the limits that regulation imposes on the normal competitive process to achieve anticompetitive ends. Doing so makes sense; an antitrust law that ignored anticompetitive behavior in any regulated industry would be a law full of holes. The role of antitrust in policing regulated industries appears to be changing, however. A cluster of Supreme Court decisions in the past decade have fundamentally altered the relationship between antitrust and regulation, placing antitrust law in a subordinate relationship that, some have argued, requires it to defer not just to regulatory decisions but perhaps even to the silence of regulatory agencies in their areas of expertise. Absolute antitrust deference to regulatory agencies makes little sense as a matter either of economics or experience. Economic theory teaches that antitrust courts are better equipped than regulators to assure efficient outcomes in many circumstances. Public choice theory - and long experience - suggests that agencies that start out trying to limit problematic behavior by industries often end up condoning that behavior and even insulating those industries from market forces. And as history has shown, relying on regulatory oversight alone without the backdrop of antitrust law would leave both temporal and substantive gaps in enforcement, which unscrupulous competitors could exploit to the clear detriment of consumers. The mere existence of a competition-conscious regulatory structure cannot guarantee against abuses of that structure, or against exclusionary behavior that falls just beyond its jurisdiction. Indeed - and perhaps ironically - the very regulatory structure that exists to promote competition can create gaming opportunities for competitors bent on achieving anti-competitive goals. Such ""regulatory gaming"" undermines both the regulatory system itself and the longstanding complementary relationship between regulatory and antitrust law. We argue that the risk of regulatory gaming provides an important example of the need for ongoing antitrust oversight of regulated industries. We define regulatory gaming as private behavior that harnesses pro-competitive or neutral regulations and uses them for exclusionary purposes. We identify three possible instances of regulatory gaming: (1) product-hopping, in which the branded company makes repeated changes in drug formulation to prevent generic substitution, rather than to improve the efficacy of the drug product; (2) manipulation of government standard-setting organizations; and (3) claims of price squeezes by partially regulated industries. Our goal in this paper is not to persuade the reader that these particular examples of regulatory gaming do or do not violate the antitrust laws. Rather, our point is that whether or not particular acts of regulatory gaming harm competition is and should be an antitrust question, not merely one that involves interpreting statutes or agency regulations. Some level of antitrust enforcement - with appropriate deference to firm decisions about product design and affirmative regulatory decisions that affect market conditions - provides a necessary check on behavior, such as product hopping, that has no purpose but to exclude competition.",2016-08-26T18:42:33.442000+00:00,"socarxiv,preprint",,,Mark Lemley,socarxiv
E00A5-33F-78A,"Intellectual Property, Antitrust, and the Rule of Law: Between Private Power and State Power","This Article explores the rule of law aspects of the intersection between intellectual property and antitrust law. Contemporary discussions and debates on intellectual property (IP), antitrust, and the intersection between them are typically framed in economically oriented terms. This Article, however, shows that there is more law in law than just economics. It demonstrates how the rule of law has influenced the development of several IP doctrines, and the interface between IP and antitrust, in important, albeit not always acknowledged, ways. In particular, it argues that some limitations on IP rights, such as exhaustion and limitations on tying arrangements, are grounded in rule of law principles restricting the arbitrary exercise of legal power, rather than solely in considerations of economic efficiency. The historical development of IP law has reflected several tensions, both economic and political, that lie at the heart of the constitutional order of the modern state: the tension between the benefits of free competition and the recognition that some restraints on competition may be beneficial and justified; the concern that power, even when conferred in the public interest, can often be abused and arbitrarily applied to advance private interests; and the tension between freedom of contract and property and freedom of trade. This Article explores how rule of law considerations have allowed courts to mediate these tensions, both in their familiar public law aspects but also in their less conspicuous private law dimensions, and how, in particular, they have shaped the development of IP doctrine and its intersection with antitrust law and the common law.",2016-07-28T16:33:07.247000+00:00,"law,preprint,socarxiv",,,Ariel Katz,socarxiv
E024B-7D0-F7D,An Overview of Causal Directed Acyclic Graphs for Substance Abuse Researchers,"Background. Within substance abuse research, quantitative methodologists tend to view randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as the “gold standard” for estimating causal effects, in part due to experimental manipulation and random assignment. Such methods are not always possible due to ethical and other reasons. Causal directed acyclic graphs (causal DAGs) are mathematical tools for (1) precisely stating researchers' causal assumptions and (2) providing guidance regarding the specification of statistical models for causal inference with nonexperimental data (such as epidemiological data). Purpose. This manuscript describes causal DAGs and illustrates their use in regards to a long standing theory within the field of substance use: the gateway hypothesis. Design. Data from the 2013 National Survey of Drug Use and Health are utilized to illustrate the application of causal DAGs in model specification. Then using the model specification constructed via causal DAGs, logistic regression models are used to generate odds ratios of the likelihood of trying heroin, given that one has tried alcohol, marijuana, and/or tobacco. Conclusion. Granting the assumptions encoded in specific causal DAGs, researchers, even in the absence of RCTs, can identify and estimate causal effects of interest.",2017-06-16T15:43:55.563355+00:00,"substance abuse researchers,acyclic graphs",,,"Alexis Kuerbis, Michael Lewis",socarxiv

It focuses on the pattern of non-derived, triliteral verbs /maCCu:C/. The sample of the study is collected from three sources Wehr (1994), Wright (1996), and Al-waSi:T Dictionary (2004). The study discusses strong, weak, geminated, and glottalized verbs using the X-skeleton of autosegmental phonology. It considers the imperfective stem as the basic form from which other forms are derived. The findings indicate that strong, geminated, and glottalized stems show regularity to the pattern /maCCu:C/. Nevertheless, irregularities from the general pattern are observed with weak verbs due to the unstable nature of glides in Standard Arabic. Also, the study shows that autosegmental phonology provides an adequate analysis for the passive participle.",2017-07-22T04:01:08.471580+00:00,"autosegmental,arabic passive participle,x-skeleton,phonological analysis",,,"Arab World English Journal, Majd S.

E015E-3A8-10E,"O Quinto Poder: o Crime Organizado, como Elemento Perturbador do Livre Desenvolvimento da Pessoa Humana e da Paz Social, e a Cooperação Luso-Brasileira","A evolução globalizadora do mundo actual tem proporcionado uma contínua internacionalização do crime, acompanhada de uma progressiva mundialização dos interesses associados a este. A criminalidade em grande escala é uma autêntica patologia do fenómeno criminal contínuo, que arrasta consigo não só pessoas físicas como também pessoas jurídicas. As organizações utilizam o fenómeno globalizador como oportunidade de desenvolvimento e fortalecimento. Hoje, o valor anual dos negócios do crime organizado é cinco vezes superior ao valor de há dez anos atrás e maior que o valor combinado do comércio internacional do petróleo, aço, produtos farmacêuticos, alimentos, trigo e açúcar. É igualmente superior aos orçamentos de muitos países desenvolvidos. O aparecimento e desenvolvimento do crime organizado está ligado a um espírito e estrutura lucrativo-empresariais, voltados para a prática de crimes com animus lucrandi quase sempre transfronteiriços. Estes enormes lucros financeiros permitem que a criminalidade organizada transnacional mine as estruturas socio-económicas. Esta circunstância é ainda agravada pela sucessiva sofisticação dos meios usados, fruto de uma sociedade tecnicamente tão dinâmica. Daí advêm novas formas de crimes pela alteração do modus faciendi, formas estas que “parasitam o sistema financeiro e utilizam de forma perversa e hábil os benefícios civilizacionais da chamada aldeia global”. Assim, houve necessidade de recorrer a uma criminalização, tornando o Direito Penal socialmente mais abrangente e, destarte, aumentando a tutela dos interesses colectivos. A maioria dos autores considera que o crime organizado só existe porque as estruturas económica e política o permitem. A fronteira entre crime organizado e o mundo dos negócios é cada vez mais ténue e observa-se que esta forma de crime está a deixar de ser parte de um submundo para passar a estar presente, em lugar de destaque, ao lado de um qualquer empresário, numa qualquer praça financeira do mundo. Constitui hoje um poder autónomo, com profissionais próprios e regras específicas. A agressividade do mundo negocial obriga muitas vezes a que os seus operadores recorram a meios legalmente menos transparentes de modo a sobreviverem. A pressão exercida pela economia é de tal forma elevada que leva a condutas negociais que ultrapassam todos os limites ético-sociais. O crime organizado está de tal forma enraizado na economia que, se a estrutura desta não for consideravelmente reformada, torna-se impossível a sua sobrevivência sem a mão facilitadora destas actividades ilícitas. Esta posição vai de encontro à defendida por Szasz, ao dizer que “those dirty little acts... quicken the wheels of commerce”. Esta forma de criminalidade arrasta consigo uma malha de ligações perigosas e altamente nefastas para a confiança dos cidadãos nas entidades administrativas, da qual é um exemplo o uso ilícito e abusivo da chamada ‘mala diplomática’ , o que põe em causa a Convenção de Viena sobre relações diplomáticas de 1961 e as restantes convenções relativas à actividade diplomática. Cria-se, assim, um clima de corrupção e intimidação que auxilia o funcionamento de qualquer organização criminosa, seja em que parte do mundo for. A criminalidade organizada é um fenómeno que afecta qualquer estrato social, faixa etária ou país, envolvendo mesmo grupos inteiros da população. Tendo em conta tamanhas proporções, a sua relevância no contexto actual ultrapassa os limites toleráveis para a sobrevivência do Estado tal como hoje o vemos. Destrói os fundamentos da economia e corrói a estabilidade, a segurança e a soberania dos Estados, assim como põe em causa o desenvolvimento da personalidade, da autonomia e da liberdade individual de cada cidadão. O indivíduo é desapossado da sua axiologia intrínseca e absorvido pelos mecanismos das organizações criminais. O domínio destas organizações põe mesmo em causa a paz mundial, tornando-se num poder acima do poder, num Estado dentro de um Estado… o Quinto Poder.",2018-02-09T12:45:22.099717+00:00,"cooperação luso-brasileira,criminalidade organizada transnacional,autonomia individual,liberdade individual,desenvolvimento da personalidade,crime organizado",,,"Sofia Cardoso, Nuno Ferreira",socarxiv
E007E-FCD-27B,Challenges of Implementing Restorative Justice for Intimate Partner Violence: An Islamic Perspective,"Intimate partner violence (IPV) is currently recognized as a critical public health concern and a human rights issue. Not surprisingly, Muslims – a religiously and socio-culturally diverse faith-based populace – are not an exception. To address this complex area of criminal justice and social policy, some scholars advocate implementing restorative justice (RJ) approaches. While RJ approaches have been traditionally used in Islamic cultures for conflict resolutions, to date, few studies have investigated how RJ operates in dealing with IPV in Muslim countries and communities. This article explores how RJ approaches towards IPV operate in some Muslim countries/communities, and offers insights into developing culturally and religiously appropriate ways of implementing RJ in IPV situations among Muslims. Given the prevalence of IPV among Muslims, the question is particularly important and timely. Taking exclusively limited examples of RJ approaches that have been used to mediate IPV cases in Muslim countries and communities, this paper found one significant challenge in the RJ approaches among Muslims: inappropriate norms/understandings about IPV. To reduce IPV in Muslim society, it is necessary to develop treatment models and techniques that meet cultural and religious needs. This paper found that since RJ is not alien to Islamic teachings, RJ approaches can be implemented effectively in dealing with IPV among Muslims by ensuring justice and equity of the abused woman. The findings of this paper will assist policymakers, practitioners, and service providers in providing religiously and culturally appropriate care when addressing IPV issues among Muslims.",2018-03-03T15:29:37.997275+00:00,"social work,restorative justice,intimate partner violence,religion,islam",,,"Md.

E0083-C48-880,"A Man's Home is His Castle, But it Has a Secret Dungeon: Domestic Violence Victims Need an Amendment to Florida's All-Party Consent Law","Domestic violence is an epidemic that is occurring at alarming rates throughout the state of Florida and across the nation. Much of that abuse occurs behind closed doors inside the home where there are no witnesses. Because Florida law does not allow a person to record communications without the consent of everyone else involved, victims are forced to rely on uncorroborated verbal accusations when they report their abuse. Unfortunately, it is difficult to prosecute these cases because they turn into credibility contests where the abuser often has an unfair advantage and has learned how to manipulate the system. If the abuse was serious enough, the victim can rely on visible physical injuries to support her allegations. That is also problematic because it forces victims to use their bodies as evidence when far more effective substitutes are available. This Note demonstrates that, although we claim domestic violence is no longer a private matter, we are effectively keeping it hidden behind closed doors by refusing to let victims record their abuse and then making it exceedingly difficult to prove their allegations without corroboration. The abuser’s right to privacy has become a priority over the victim’s safety. This Note argues that domestic violence victims need the ability to record the abuse they suffer inside the homes they share with their abusers. Finally, this Note proposes a statutory amendment to Florida’s all-party consent law that would achieve this goal.",2018-08-01T14:23:48.305452+00:00,"domestic violence,all-party consent,eavesdropping,recording conversations,florida surveillance,florida communications",,,David K.

British Politics and Policy LSE blog, London.","Judged by the level of political debate, public policy and academic literature, the work of children (under-18s) in England and Wales is neither of interest nor of concern. And yet the absence of this topic from the policy agenda is far from indicative of its lack of relevance or timeliness. In fact, figures from the Labour Force Survey suggest that about a third of young people aged 16-17 are active in the labour market. Many of these young people, and others even younger, work illegally for a range of reasons: because of the number of hours worked, their age, the type of work carried out, the time of day worked, or because they lack a work permit. Indeed, in 2013, Nils Muižnieks – the Council of Europe’s Commissioner for Human Rights – reported on children working long hours in the UK as a consequence of the late 2000s economic crisis. And in 2015, at a seminar held in Liverpool, several children of high school age spoke candidly about practices of dubious legality that they experienced at work, including low pay, informal work arrangements, deficient health and safety conditions, and sexist recruitment procedures, not to speak of detrimental effects to their education. More generally, we should be alarmed that children who work mainly carry out unskilled and manual labour, are poorly paid, acquire limited recognisable skills, jeopardise their educational attainment, sustain accidental injuries (in particular in delivery and agricultural work), may not be covered by insurance and accident cover, are often burdened with caring duties, and may even be recruited by the military.

This paper draws upon anthropology of insult to uncover the distinctness, if at all, of online abuse as a means for political participation as well as for the encumbering it provokes and relations of domination it reproduces as a result. In so doing, the paper critiques the conception of ludic as anti-hegemonic in the Bakhtian tradition, and develops an emic term ‘gaali’ to signal the blurred boundaries between comedy, insult, shame and abuse emerging on online media which also incite gendered forms of intimidation. Gaali, it argues, is best conceptualized through the metaphor of ‘sound’ as distinct from what recent new media studies theorize as ‘voice’.",2018-11-07T14:12:41.052263+00:00,"gender violence online,online insult,social media,india,online humor,bakhtin,trolling,digital politics,online abuse",,,Sahana Udupa,socarxiv
E0125-1B3-4F2,Pathways of Global Cultural Diffusion: Mass Media and People's Moral Declarations about Men's Violence against Women,"Current theories of global cultural diffusion outline abstract mechanisms through which cultural scripts spread across the world. To reveal how scripts reach individuals, it is necessary to identify the specific pathways of diffusion. I examine the case of how scripts about gender relations and violence are diffused through mass media to people in Malawi. Using a mixed methods approach, I find that international development organizations work with Malawian journalists to produce an array of content denouncing the practice of men abusing women. However, entertainment media companies disseminate content portraying patriarchal gender stereotypes. I show that mass media content critical of men’s violence of women is positively associated with people’s stated rejection of this practice, while individuals’ exposure to content mixed with patriarchal scripts is not. Notably, a one standard deviation increase in the number of newspaper articles critically covering men’s abuse toward women in the 30 days leading up to when a survey respondent is personally interviewed is associated with a 3.2 (women) or 2.1 (men) percentage point increase in their probability of stating that they condemn such violence. Broadly, the results outline a multifaceted portrait of global cultural diffusion, with liberal and patriarchal scripts simultaneously reaching individual people.",2018-12-04T14:06:44.446839+00:00,"diffusion,malawi,globalization,men's violence against women,culture,mass media",,,Jeffrey Swindle,socarxiv

This rejection generated strained familial ties within families wherein the ties were already fragile. Likewise, the author shows how being gender expansive marked many youth’s experi- ences of familial abuse and strain.

We are concerned about the design, analysis, reporting and reviewing of quantitative IS studies that draw on null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). We observe that debates about misinterpretations, abuse, and issues with NHST, while having persisted for about half a century, remain largely absent in IS. We find this an untenable position for a discipline with a proud quantitative tradition. We discuss traditional and emergent threats associated with the application of NHST and examine how they manifest in recent IS scholarship. To encourage the development of new standards for NHST in hypothetico-deductive IS research, we develop a balanced account of possible actions that are implementable short-term or long-term and that incentivize or penalize specific practices. To promote an immediate push for change, we also develop two sets of guidelines that IS scholars can adopt right away.",2019-05-27T12:51:31.672548+00:00,"quantitative research,p-value,null hypothesis significance testing,survey,statistics,positivist research,experiment",,,"Jan Recker, Willem Mertens",socarxiv

This type of research falls into the emerging field of learning analytics. However, learning analytics research tends to ignore the issue of the reliability of results that are based on MOOCs data, which is typically noisy and generated by a largely anonymous crowd of learners. This paper provides evidence that learning analytics in MOOCs can be significantly biased by users who abuse the anonymity and open-nature of MOOCs, for example by setting up multiple accounts, due to their amount and aberrant behavior. We identify these users, denoted fake learners, using dedicated algorithms. The methodology for measuring the bias caused by fake learners’ activity combines the ideas of Replication Research and Sensitivity Analysis. We replicate two highly-cited learning analytics studies with and without fake learners data, and compare the results. While in one study, the results were relatively stable against fake learners, in the other, removing the fake learners’ data significantly changed the results.

The story was variously framed as one more vicious murder of Middle Eastern Christians by militant Islamists, one more index of chaos in post-Qaddafi Libya and one more opportunity for an Arab state, in this case Egypt, to enlist in the latest phase of the war on terror. What was left unaddressed was the deep and long-standing enmeshment of the Libyan and Egyptian economies, embodied in the tens of thousands of Egyptian workers who remain in Libya despite the civil war raging there. There is a history of maltreatment of Egyptian migrants in Libya spanning more than 60 years. The abuses date back to the organized migration of Egyptian teachers, bureaucrats and other professionals under Gamal Abdel Nasser, and have continued with increasing brutality until the present. From the beginning, whether under King Idris, under Muammar al-Qaddafi or following the colonel’s downfall, the causes of the violence have been distinctly political, with Egyptians in Libya always vulnerable to the vicissitudes of Egyptian-Libyan state relations as well as to regional crises.

E022B-CA0-36B,The 2017 French Riots and Trust in the Police. A Quasi-Experimental Approach.,"On February 2, 2017, French police officers brutally abused a young black man, leading to the first wave of 2017 French riots. The present study exploits the coincidence that the focal event occurred during the survey period of the European Social Survey (ESS) 2016 (Nov. 11, 2016 – March 11, 2017) in France, thus providing the basis for a Natural Experiment on the effect of media reporting on police misconduct on trust in the police. Data is analyzed by means of a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) as well as more conventional regression analyses with heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors. In line with procedural justice theory as well as institutional theory, the present study finds support for the notion that this special case of police misconduct did decrease trust in the police. In addition, people reporting a migrant background show even less trust in the police after the event. Frequency of different media consumption does not appear to explain deterioration of trust in the police after the event. The results of this study increase the internal and external validity of the assumption that trust in the police can be explained not only by personal experiences, but also by the perceived unfair treatment of others. Results are robust to various placebo tests. There is some evidence that the effect seems to be short-lived, although the data basis is limited in this regard. Several fruitful approaches for future studies are discussed.",2019-08-15T15:09:51.874588+00:00,,,,"Mark Lutter, Christof Nägel",socarxiv
E0047-A77-0DA,“My daughter is not like that”: A qualitative study of parental perception on child sexual abuse risk,"The aim of this study was to explore parental beliefs on the risk of CSA, specifically victim- and perpetrator-specific risk of child sexual abuse to their children, as well as parents' approaches to protecting their children. Data were collected from 22 parents during focus group interviews (n=6) combined with activity-oriented questions. Based on data, four perpetrator and two victim-specific risk profiles were created. When parents find similarities between their children and perceived victims or perpetrators, it triggers the defensive othering effect, which acts as a subconscious protection mechanism, yet often creates inaccurate risk assessment and false confidence. The findings also tender that most parents do not teach their children the necessary skills related to CSA since they determine the risk to be low. This study adds to our understanding of CSA-related risk perception and prevention approaches, offering a conceptual addition to the defensive attribution theory. Further investigation is needed on the impacts of the cognitive processes and psychological protection mechanisms in relation to CSA risk assessment. The data from this study will be useful in developing CSA prevention programs and materials.",2021-03-11T13:17:56.115862+00:00,"defensive othering,qualitative methods,child sexual abuse,rape myths,risk perception,parenting,victimization,focus groups,parent-led csa education,sex offender profiles,othering,stereotypes",,,Simone Eelmaa,socarxiv

E00AE-91C-809,"“No blood, no foul”?: How invalidating responses to non-physical intimate partner abuse imperils victims","In Australian legislation and policy, definitions of intimate partner abuse acknowledge that it is an ongoing pattern employed by a perpetrator in order to gain or maintain control, foster dependency, and erode the self-worth of the victim and can include behaviours that are physical, sexual, emotional, or psychological in nature. However, societal responses – from service providers, and friends and family – to help seeker’s disclosures of non-physical abuse are indicative of much narrower understandings. This thesis draws on qualitative data derived from semi-structured interviews with nine survivors of non-physical abuse to examine how responses to help seeking efforts influence stay/leave decision-making. Constructivist grounded theory was used in the analysis of responses from which two categories emerged – invalidating and validating. Invalidating responses inhibited further help seeking and prolonged exposure to abuse. Validating responses prompted efforts to alleviate or leave abuse. Drawing on the thesis findings, the discussion and analysis centre on better understanding the social foundations of decision-making and responses. These include: the reasons responses are so influential in the decision-making process, why responses are often incongruent with current policy and practice guidelines, conceptions of abuse in popular discourse, and the impact of social norms and popular discourse on non-help seeking behaviours. Following from this, some of the measures that might be employed to change societal responses to intimate partner abuse are discussed. The current study found that responses to participant’s help seeking efforts were influential in their decisions to stay in, or leave the relationship. The findings indicate that responses to help-seeking efforts are derived from public perceptions of, and attitudes to, intimate partner abuse. Poor understandings can result in poor responses, which can ultimately put the victim at risk. The current societal focus on physical manifestations of abuse belies the complexity of the problem and is detrimental to efforts to address intimate partner abuse. Improved awareness and acknowledgment of the impact of non-physical intimate partner abuse is therefore critical to domestic violence reduction and intervention.",2019-09-24T11:06:31.393401+00:00,"non-physical abuse,help-seeking,domestic abuse,intimate partner abuse",,,Jenni Nathan,socarxiv
E01A3-4FA-75F,Harmful digital communications in New Zealand: Annual Population Survey 2017,"While new technologies offer a number of benefits and opportunities, their use is accompanied by challenges and potential risks. This includes the different forms of abuse and intimidation that the Act seeks to address. As part of its functions as the Approved Agency, Netsafe has conducted the first in a series of Annual Population Surveys (APS). The objective of the APS is to gauge attitudes and behaviours and to start monitoring national trends regarding potentially harmful digital communications in Aotearoa-New Zealand. This report presents the main findings of the 2017 APS. The APS is the first nationally representative study that looks at adult New Zealanders and digital communications in the context of the Act. Key aspects of the Act - such as the communication principles - and key internet safety concepts have informed the development of the research instrument and the analysis of its findings. The study was planned and administered by Netsafe between February and September 2017. An online survey was conducted with a representative sample of 1,018 adult New Zealanders (aged 18 ) between 30 May and 30 June 2017. Data collection was conducted by Colmar Brunton. The maximum margin of error for the whole population is ±3.1% at the 95% confidence level. The study provides insights regarding New Zealanders’ access to and use of digital technologies. It also explores people’s level of awareness of the Act. A key focus of the study is to measure participants’ experiences of digital communications, including perceptions and experiences of harm and distress in the last 12 months. Finally, the study presents relevant insights regarding New Zealanders’ personal responses, and access to services and resources to deal with unwanted digital communications as well as potential harm and distress. As research on adult New Zealanders and their experiences with digital communications is limited, the APS provides first-hand research evidence on this subject to government agencies, online content and service providers, law enforcement, the research community, and the general public. However, considering the evolving nature of new technologies and how people engage with digital tools, new online challenges and risks are likely to emerge. Thus, the study of the nature and impact of digital communications, including potential harm and distress, will remain a relevant but challenging area of research, analysis, and policy intervention.",2019-12-18T21:40:37.046510+00:00,"survey,online harrassment,technology,cyber abuse,social media,online harm,cyberbullying,quantitative research,digital communications,digital communication internet",,,"Edgar Pacheco, Neil Melhuish",socarxiv
E0072-B0D-762,Online hate speech: A survey on personal experiences and exposure among adult New Zealanders,"Online hate speech has been a topic of public concern and research interest for some time. Initially the focus of this centred on the proliferation of online groups and websites promoting and distributing discriminatory content. Since the introduction of more interactive tools and platforms in the mid-2000s that enabled new and faster ways of disseminating content in a relatively anonymous fashion, concerns about online hate speech becoming a pervasive behavior have increased. Current research and analysis acknowledge the complex nature of online hate, the mediating role of technology and the influence of other contextual factors (e.g. social or political events). However, despite the growing attention on the topic, New Zealand-based research looking at personal experiences and/or exposure to online hate is surprisingly absent. This study seeks to address this gap. It builds on existing international research on young people’s experiences to explore those of the adult New Zealand population based on a nationally representative sample. The research instrument used for this study was an online survey. The survey was administered by Colmar Brunton in June 2018.

E0070-6CA-726,Denouncing child manipulation to produce sexualised imagery on YouTube,"Over the last decade, a vast YouTube-based ‘market’ of child-produced content involving sexualised behaviour has developed. Children-performers produce videos featuring implicit sexual imagery to satisfy the demands of an adult fan base, and in exchange for a digital reward. We first report the discovery of several YouTube keywords leading to such content, outlining their remarkable interconnectedness via analysis of search trends over the last decade. Following, we investigate audience-child interactions by semantic analysis of n=1398 comments mined from n=30 videos, revealing the occurrence of collective grooming. We then demonstrate how this phenomenon is sustained and enhanced by YouTube search algorithms. Following, we detail a model framework to contextualise our findings. Finally, we propose specific amendments to the 2018 Online Harms White Paper that might tackle this phenomenon. Our results reveal a new form of child abuse, as of yet undescribed, wherein the core features of online grooming are translated to social media, the fundamental principles of which act as a powerful incentive. Because the victim’s manipulation is enacted collectively, we believe that responsibility ultimately rests with society as a whole. The principal aim here is to raise awareness of this issue, in an attempt to kick-start discussion of its causes, implications and potential solutions.",2020-04-12T03:30:07.291855+00:00,"child abuse,social media,youtube,like",,,"Jasmin Walravens-Evans, Simone Grannò, Alessio Mosca",socarxiv
E00F4-08C-0A8,Prevalence and Determinants of Dating Violence: An Umbrella Review of Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses,"Objective: Dating violence (DV) is a psychosocial problem which impacts the health and wellbeing of affected individuals. Many studies have reported a high prevalence and various determinants of DV; however, there is a gap of consolidated evidence on this problem. This umbrella review aimed to synthesize the current evidence on the prevalence and determinants of DV from systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Methods: We systematically searched ten major databases and additional sources to retrieve systematic reviews or meta-analyses reporting prevalence or determinants of DV, published as peer-reviewed journal articles in English language till October 13, 2019. We extracted and synthesized the findings, reported the prevalence of DV, and categorized the determinants of DV using the socioecological model. Results: We found 16 eligible systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Most of these studies were conducted in developed countries with a majority of adolescent and young adult participants. Studies reported varying prevalence of physical, sexual, psychological/emotional, and technology-assisted DV ranging from 0.1% to 57.5%, 0.1% to 64.6%, 4.2% to 97%, and 5.8% to 92%, respectively. The determinants of DV at different socioecological levels, including individual behavior, substance abuse, psychiatric conditions, experiencing violence and maltreatment; interpersonal factors like family and peer relationships; community and neighborhood characteristics; patriarchy, culture, and socioeconomic equalities were reported. Conclusions: These findings suggest a high burden of DV among young populations, who are vulnerable to various socioecological determinants of DV.

We examine crime effects for one UK police force area in comparison to 5-year averages. There is variation in the onset of change by crime type, some declining from the WHO ‘global pandemic’ announcement of 11 March, others later. By one week after the 23 March lockdown, all recorded crime had declined 41%, with variation: shoplifting (-62%), theft (-52%), domestic abuse (-45%), theft from vehicle (-43%), assault (-36%), burglary dwelling (-25%) and burglary non-dwelling (-25%). We use Google Covid-19 Consumer Mobility Reports to calculate the mobility elasticity of crime for four crime types, finding shoplifting and other theft inelastic but responsive to reduced retail sector mobility (MEC = 0.84, 0.71 respectively), burglary dwelling elastic to increases in residential area mobility (-1), with assault inelastic but responsive to reduced workplace mobility (0.56). We theorise that crime rate changes were primarily caused by those in mobility, suggesting a mobility theory of crime change in the pandemic.

E017B-67D-0C2,"""All the problems in the community are multi-faceted and related to each other"": Inuit concerns in an era of climate change","Human dimensions of climate change research in the Arctic often proposes ways for local communities to adapt to changes to their environment, foregrounding problems posed by climate change while treating social, political and economic factors as background conditions. We explore the relevance of this research paradigm for Inuit by examining how Inuit from Kangiqsujuaq present and discuss the major issues facing their community. We thematically code and analyze the responses of 107 Inuit to three free-response questions about the problems facing their community and the best things about their community. The data were collected as part of a questionnaire for a project focused on food security and food sharing conducted in Kangiqsujuaq, Nunavik, in 2013–2014. Few respondents mentioned issues relating to climate change among the most pressing problems facing their community. Rather, a suite of interconnected social and economic issues, particularly substance abuse and the cost of living, emerged as the main concerns of Kangiqsujuarmiut. However, the environment was a central theme in respondents’ favourite thing about their community. In light of the concerns identified by Inuit, we argue that much research on climate change makes incorrect a priori assumptions and consequently fails to capture aspects of Arctic socioecological systems that are essential for how Inuit are responding to climate change. An inductive, open-ended approach can help produce research more relevant to communities.",2020-10-01T00:35:25.139294+00:00,"inuit,community-based research,arctic,adaptation and vulnerability,climate change",,,"Elspeth Ready, Peter Collings",socarxiv
E009B-741-5EB,Police-involved deaths and the impact on homicide rates in the post-Ferguson era: a study of 44 US cities,"This study investigated whether homicides increased after protested police-involved deaths, focusing on the period after Michael Brown’s death in Ferguson in August 2014. It also tests for effects of legal cynicism by comparing effects in homicide and aggravated assault on the assumption that reporting of the latter is discretionary and police abuses may make communities reluctant to notify police. Using FBI data from 44 US cities, homicide and assault rates from 2011 to 2019 were analysed using an interrupted time series design and combined in a meta-analysis to calculate pooled effects. A meta-regression tested effect moderators including external investigations and city/county sociodemographic characteristics. With a conservative threshold of p ≤ 0.01, 21 of the 44 cities experienced a significant increase and one had a significant decrease. The pooled effect was a 26.1% increase in the homicide (99% CI: 15.3% to 36.8%). Aggravated assaults increased above baseline, though the effect was 15.1 percentage points smaller (99% CI: -26.7 to -3.6) than the effect in homicides. When outcomes were measured as percent change, there were no significant effect moderators, but when measured as absolute change, homicides increased to a greater extent when the death was subject to external investigation and in cities with higher black populations, poverty rates, and baseline homicide rates. The findings suggest that protested police-involved deaths led to an increase in homicides and other violence due to the distrust fomented within the very communities whom police are meant to protect.",2020-10-24T15:56:38.152311+00:00,"police violence,crime reporting,homicide,interrupted time series",,,Tyler J Lane,socarxiv
E00BA-F10-3F1,Windows of Repression: Using COVID-19 Policies against Political Dissidents?,"What explains the great variation in the adoption, timing, and duration of government policies made in response to the COVID-19 pandemic? In this paper, we explore whether government incentives to repress domestic dissidents influence their responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. We argue that containment policies are observationally equivalent to those that abusive governments would use to limit domestic dissent --- i.e., policies that restrict citizen's freedom of movement. This creates an opportunity for abusive governments to engage in repressive behavior without countervailing pressure from citizens and the international community. Following this logic, we expect abusive governments to be more likely to adopt restrictive policies, adopt them earlier in the course of the pandemic, and take longer to relax restrictions. Empirically, we find that governments that have recently engaged in state violence against civilians or abused citizens' human rights were about 10 percent more likely to enact lockdown and curfew policies, and these policies were implemented approximately 48 days earlier in the course of the pandemic and kept in place for approximately 23 more days than less repressive countries. Overall, our results advance our understanding of how the repressiveness of state institutions can shape policy responses to a global health crisis.",2020-11-12T13:03:56.802438+00:00,"health policy,pandemics,disaster politics,civil liberties,pandemic",,,"Luca Messerschmidt, Robert Kubinec, Cindy Cheng, Joan Barceló, Tiril Høye Rahn",socarxiv

E00FC-816-341,Mental Health and Domestic Violence in LGB+ Persons during Lockdown Measures in Belgium,"Background: To contain the COVID-19 pandemic, governments worldwide restricted social and physical contact by issuing lockdown and social-distancing measures. Yet, lockdown measures may induce mental health problems and increase the occurrence of domestic violence (DV). We examine mental health and DV in lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual and asexual (LGB+) persons under lockdown. Methods: An online self-report questionnaire on relationships, stress and aggression was administered to a non-probabilistic sample of participants living in Belgium. Participants were sampled through national media, social media, and snowballing procedures. Occurrence of DV including psychological, physical and sexual violence, stress, alcohol and drug use, suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, self-harming behaviour, and help-seeking behaviour in LGB+ persons during the first four to six weeks of the hygiene and lockdown measures in Belgium were assessed. Results: 383 LGB+ participants were included in the analysis. In addition to high levels of stress, alcohol and drug abuse, suicidal ideation and self-harming behaviour, a third of LGB+ participants reported at least one incident of DV under lockdown. Conclusion: LGB+ persons have been exposed to DV and experienced lower mental health and wellbeing during the lockdown related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Here we outline the current scope of research in cultural tree thinking, highlighting a toolkit of best practices to navigate and avoid the pitfalls and ‘abuses’ associated with their application. We emphasise two principles that support the appropriate application of phylogenetic methodologies in cross-cultural research: researchers should (1) draw on multiple lines of evidence when deciding if and which types of phylogenetic methods and models are suitable for their cross-cultural data, and (2) carefully consider how different cultural traits might have different evolutionary histories across space and time.

This study aimed to research the value and implications of using machine translation in vocabulary acquisition. The study is significant as it investigates a neglected area in teaching a second language focusing on the role of MT in vocabulary acquisition. The empirical study adopted a combined quantitative and qualitative methodology that tested students’ skills in answering vocabulary questions in context by using online translators. Forty-seven participants took part in the assessment voluntarily, and they were all fourth-year students about to graduate from an Omani private university. The findings confirmed the results of earlier research about the challenges ESL learners face in vocabulary acquisition, including difficulties in processing sequential lexical patterns and using vocabulary communicatively. The results further revealed that online translators do not provide an optimal solution to overcome obstacles in using vocabulary unless accompanied by higher metacognitive skills such as critical thinking and using words in context.

Furthermore, the discussion was underscored by the central question of who is a minor, which feeds the already problematic definitional ambiguity and keeps the perceived discursive boundaries of the illegality of SOM in flux.

Using an event history approach, this study analyzes earnings instability—measured by one-time wage shocks, cumulative wage shocks, and stable earnings duration—on child maltreatment risk. It also pays attention to the role of safety net programs on buffering the risk of adverse wage shocks on child welfare involvement. I find that experiencing a negative earnings shock of 30% or more increases the likelihood of CPS involvement by approximately 18%. The effect diminishes and becomes nonsignificant when an earnings decline is compensated by benefit receipt. Each additional earnings drop is associated with a 15% greater likelihood of CPS involvement. Each consecutive quarter with stable income is associated with 5% lower probability of a CPS report. The results are more pronounced for abuse than neglect and are marginally significant for neglect reports. The findings suggest that accessing sufficient social benefits as supplemental income when negative earnings shocks occur serves to effectively buffer against the risk of child maltreatment, particularly among families with young children. This study confirms income support as an important instrument to reduce child maltreatment risk; it indicates that policies aimed at boosting income and stabilizing low-income family economics could substantially increase children’s safety and well-being.",2021-04-15T14:55:13.136970+00:00,"social policy,child welfare involvement,earnings instability,income supplement,employment instability",,,Julie Yixia Cai,socarxiv
E01FC-D0C-E79,Innovative Practices in Instructor E-feedback: A Case Study of E-feedback given in Three Linguistic Courses during the COVID 19 Pandemic,"This study aimed to investigate the instructor’s electronic feedback practices during the COVID 19 Pandemic in terms of the nature of the content of e-feedback, the formulation, the challenges, and the multimodal nature of the instructor’s e-feedback. This study used a qualitative case study to obtain data from the instructor’s e-feedback in three linguistic courses as delivered, practiced by the single English language instructor. The instructor’s e-feedback via Blackboard and WhatsApp platform and the follow-up interview were analyzed qualitatively. The findings indicate that (1) the highest number of instructor’s e-feedback focused on global issues as compared to local issues, (2) the instructor composed his e-feedback in the form of eight main categories: explanations, suggestions, clarifications, questioning, repetitions, statements, praises, and commands, (3) the instructor used more screencasts for providing e-feedback, followed by written and audio modes respectively. The thematic analysis (4) revealed the instructor’s positive impression on providing e-feedback through these interactive modes (written, audio, and screencast) and a range of challenging issues such as students’ preference issues, technical issues, timing issues, financial and areal issues. This study is significant because it provides us with a comprehensive picture of the patterns of the feedback content, the formulation of the e-feedback, the multimodality of the instructor’s e-feedback, and the significant issues that emerged from the instructor’s e-feedback practices. However, further research should include a relative group of instructors to determine the impact of e-feedback on learners.",2021-05-20T14:55:00.755549+00:00,"whatsapp,blackboard,covid-19 pandemic,screencast,linguistics,e-feedback",,,"Mohammad Shariq, Atef O.

There, women are bound to doing housework and rearing children; they are a mere tool to meet their husbands’ pleasures and find concubines when needed. Accordingly, the study examines the sources , and types of psychological trauma experienced by the character O-lan, and later by the oppressors, her husband and his new wife, Wang Lung , in Buck’s novel The Good Earth. To meet the objective of the study, Robinson, Smith, &amp; Segal’s (2020) types of trauma will be adopted in the analysis. Such a study help know more about the traditions and values of Chinese society, the role of women there. It further reflects the negative societal consequence s of abusing and humiliating women, and the curse men will gain due to their unjust treatment of their wives. The psychological trauma of O-lan is highly indicated by her husband’s speech and behavior. He constantly belittles her role a wife, neglecting her emotions.

E0198-2A5-490,Not All Homes are Safe: Family Violence Following the Onset of the Covid-19 Pandemic,"Evidence from victim service providers suggests the COVID-19 pandemic led to an increase in family violence. However, empirical evidence has been limited. This study uses novel survey data to investigate the occurrence of family violence during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Data come from the second wave of the Assessing the Social Consequences of COVID-19 study, an online non-probability sample collected in April and May 2020. Family violence is measured using four variables: any violence, physical violence, verbal abuse, and restricted access. The authors use logistic regression and KHB decomposition to examine the prevalence of family violence during the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that sexual minorities, in particular bisexual people, experienced higher rates of family violence than heterosexual respondents. Women were the only group to report an increase in the frequency of family violence. Household income loss is associated with the incidence of verbal violence. Our findings demonstrate the importance of expanding victim services to address the additional barriers victims face within the pandemic context and beyond, including broad contexts of social isolation and financial precarity experienced by individuals at risk of family violence.",2021-07-06T14:30:58.782012+00:00,"gender,sexuality,covid-19,family violence,family strain",,,"Jessica N.

But how does the public judge MNE involvement in human rights violations? We empirically answer this question drawing on an original survey of American adults. We asked respondents to judge over 12,000 randomly generated scenarios in which MNEs may be considered to have been involved in human rights violations. Our findings reveal substantial gaps between public judgments and the standards set in soft law and the normative literature. We identify the attributes of episodes of human rights violations involving MNEs that influence public judgments, including the relationship between the MNE and the perpetrator, the practice of due diligence, and the type of abuse. These results provide insights as to when we might expect public pressure to drive MNE compliance with soft law instruments, and they direct attention to specific standards that will likely require stronger, ‘hard’ law approaches or broader efforts to shift the public’s view",2021-11-06T16:53:20.747766+00:00,,,,"Rita Mota, Alex Rustler, Matthew Amengual",socarxiv
E005E-3B0-86E,Valuation regimes in academia: Researchers’ attitudes towards their diversity of activities and academic performance,"Evaluation systems have been long criticised for abusing and misusing bibliometric indicators. This has created a culture by which academics are constantly exposing their daily work to the standards they are expected to perform. In this study we investigate whether researchers’ own values and expectations are in line with the expectations of the evaluation system. We conduct a multiple case-study of five departments in two Dutch universities to examine how they balance between their own valuation regimes and the evaluation schemes. For this we combine curriculum analysis with a series of semi-structured interviews. We propose a model to study diversity of academic activities and apply it to the multiple-case study to understand how such diversity is shaped by discipline and career stage. We conclude that the observed misalignment is not only resulting from an abuse of metrics, but also by a lack of tools to evaluate performance in a contextualised and adaptable way.",2021-11-10T11:21:51.177160+00:00,"scientometrics,evaluation culture,research careers,academia,research evaluation",,,"Tina Nane, Nicolas Robinson-Garcia, Thed N van Leeuwen, Rodrigo Costas",socarxiv
E0012-DCD-F80,Distorted and Limiting Semantically Divergent Translated Meaning of Arabic Loanwords in the Malay Language as Educational Instrument,"Historically, the language contact contributed by Muslim preachers among the Arab traders of diverse origins that some of them opted to migrate and intermarry with the local Malays, thus, intermingled with the locals that had influenced the Malay/Malaysian language to borrow more Arabic words. Some semantic properties of the loanwords are adopted, but some are adapted. This study concerns with the divergent meaning of some adapted ones. 18 Malay-Arabic homophonous loanwords were purposely sampled – (the limited sample is due to the journal words limit). It is observed that despite of their similar utterance and spelling/transliteration but they have partially or fully dissimilar meanings when being compared between the two languages. Generally, it may confuse users of both languages, specifically the Arabian students who are compulsory to pass the Malay language in order to pass their study in Malaysia as well as Malay students who are studying in Arabian countries. Moreover, it may affect their meaning in the Malay translation for the Holy Qur’an/Prophetic Tradition (Hadith). So, it is essential to engage academics of the Islamic studies, and the Malay-Arabic linguists alike with the crucial issue stemmed from the bilingual mastery level that involved both languages departing from the rising movement of re-examining and re-envision criticality in language studies. Henceforth, the Malaysian Muslim society could dynamically develop further ahead after more than 10 centuries exposed to the Arabic language rather than being stagnant in minimalism evermore.",2021-11-12T18:56:52.038448+00:00,,,,"Mohd Nizam bin Sahad, Nur Afifah binti Abas, Alia Sa’ad Eldin Abusahyon",socarxiv
E00D6-7D9-C85,"Verbal Aggression on Social Media: How, why and its Automatic Identification","In recent times, verbal aggression and related phenomena of hate speech, abusive language, trolling, etc. have become a major problem over social media. In this paper, I present the results of a large-scale quantitative study of aggression based on a target-based typology in a manually-annotated multilingual dataset of over 20,000 Facebook comments and tweets each written in Hindi, English or code-mixed Hindi-English. Taking insights from this study, I develop 2 different classifiers for detecting aggression in Hindi, English and Hindi-English mixed Facebook and Twitter conversations. The classifiers are developed using an annotated corpus of approximately 9,000 Facebook comments and 5,000 tweets. Since a phenomenon like aggression is highly subjective, the study shows a comparatively modest inter-annotator agreement of 0.72 and an overall F1 score of 0.64 for both Facebook and Twitter. Consequently, I also carried out two user studies, where humans were asked to evaluate the annotations by the classifier, to test the actual 'acceptance' of the classifier's judgments. I discuss the results of this user study and give an analysis of the overall performance of the system.",2021-12-02T16:18:05.453842+00:00,"hindi-english,abusive language,twitter,aggression,hindi,facebook,code-mixing,verbal aggression,trolling,hate speech,automatic identification",,,Ritesh Kumar,socarxiv

A cross-sectional analysis of data from 4,731 adults in the United States","Arts engagement is a health-related behavior that may be influenced by social inequalities. While the COVID-19 pandemic provided new opportunities for some people to engage in the arts, it might have created barriers for others. We aimed to examine whether there was social patterning in home-based arts engagement during the pandemic in the United States (US), and whether predictors of engagement differed according to the type of arts activity. We included 4,731 adults who participated in the US COVID-19 Social Study between April and July 2020. Three types of home-based arts engagement were considered: reading for pleasure, arts or crafts activities, and digital arts activities. Using logistic regression models, we tested cross-sectional associations between a broad range of demographic, socioeconomic, psychosocial, and health-related factors as well as adverse events and worries during lockdown and each type of arts engagement. The factors most strongly associated with all three types of arts engagement were social support, social network size, age, race/ethnicity, keyworker status, and experiencing physical or psychological abuse during the pandemic. However, most socioeconomic and health-related factors were not associated with arts engagement, including household income and mental and physical health problems. Overall, our findings indicate that the social gradient in arts engagement was reduced in the first four months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US. Given the health benefits of arts engagement, the potential diversification of arts audiences during the pandemic is promising for both population-level health and wellbeing and the future of the arts and cultural sector.",2021-12-22T22:25:26.029570+00:00,,,,"Hei Wan Mak, Jill Sonke, Heidi Radunovich, Daisy Fancourt, Meg Fluharty, Jenny Lee, Jessica Bone, Anthony J Kolenic, Randy Cohen",socarxiv

Constructing the stereotype of the “ideal victim” of child sexual abuse,"The stereotype of the “ideal victim” often determines who is considered deserving of victim status, especially in sexual violence cases. In this Chapter, we explore how is the so-called “ideal victim” stereotype constructed and what are the elements necessary for the perception of “ideal victimhood.” We use empirical data from an unmoderated anonymous Estonian online forum that hosts various topic threads from children and young people, including posts about personally experienced sexual violence (N=28) and replies to these posts (N=361). The data was analyzed by combining a discursive psychological approach with qualitative thematic analysis. Results reveal and illustrate how the stereotype is constructed from various elements and characteristics of social scripts, perceived gender roles, and misconceptions about sexuality. We unveil how these social constructions affect responses and attitudes towards sexual abuse victims to provide input for designing prevention efforts that support disclosure and help-seeking.",2021-12-25T19:28:17.501726+00:00,"rape myths,sexual violence,victim blaming,victimology,discursive psychology,help-seeking,disclosure,online communication,child sexual abuse,stereotypes",,,"Maria Murumaa-Mengel, Simone Eelmaa",socarxiv
E0099-9BB-C14,Aggressive Language in Literature: A Pragmatic Approach,"Aggression is a negative form of an anti-social behavior. It is produced because of a particular reason, desire, want, need, or due to the psychological state of the aggressor. It injures others physically or psychologically. Aggressive behaviors in human interactions cause discomfort and disharmony among interlocutors. The paper aims to identify how aggressive language manifests itself in the data under scrutiny in terms of the pragmatic paradigm. Two British literary works are the data; namely, Look Back in Anger by John Osborne (1956), and The Birthday Party by Harold Pinter (1957). This paper endeavors to answer the question of how aggressive language is represented in literature pragmatically? It is hoped to be significant to linguistic and psychological studies in that it clarifies how aggression is displayed in human communications linguistically. Qualitative and quantitative analyses are conducted to verify the findings. It ends with some concluding remarks, the most important of which are: insulting, belittling, ridiculing and threatening are prevalent speech acts; simile, hyperbole, metaphor and repetition appear due to Grice’s maxims breaching while the use of taboo words, calling names, or abusive words are the impoliteness strategies that are distinguished in the data.",2022-01-07T20:41:43.446073+00:00,"the birthday party,grice maxims,types of communication,pragmatics,literary plays,aggression,look back in anger",,,"Hanan Abdul-kareem Kadhim, Wafaa S.

Results indicate that, generally, greater social participation is associated with increased drinking days per month. We also find that religious participation and having ever lived with an alcoholic are each associated with reporting possible alcohol dependence, but not with alcohol consumption itself. Lastly, we identify gendered associations between marital dissolution and drinking behavior. These findings contextualize the increasing rates of alcohol abuse in later life by emphasizing the possible negative consequences of “linked lives” on health, via relationship stress and group norms.",2022-03-09T15:42:20.909178+00:00,"alcohol,wisconsin longitudinal study,family,health behaviors,social participation",,,"Joseph Lariscy, Eric Vogelsang",socarxiv

Departing from other domestic worker agencies that primarily act as brokers to ensure labour supply of domestic workers for prospective household employers, The Maids’ Company sought to: i. Ensure basic rights, minimum wages and workplace-related benefits for the women domestic workers recruited, trained and placed by them ii. Shift attitudes and behaviours of clients towards providing decent work for domestic workers The company adopted a number of innovations and gender-responsive strategies during different phases of its operation, with an attempt being made to keep in mind the realities of women workers. For instance, a woman community-based social mobiliser was appointed in the target area of intervention, helping to build trust and expand recruitment among local women by an ‘insider’. During trainings and skilling, besides imparting know-how of technical skills (cooking, cleaning) and soft skills, women were taught to remain alert and report to the Company any instances of sexual harassment/ abuse. The format and facilitation of trainings was conducted to ensure proximity of the training venue to the living settlement of women workers, flexible hours and female trainers. Recognising constraints on women’s time and mobility to attend long, classroom-based trainings, innovations such as ‘Dekho Seekho’—a digital skill-learning platform—was developed by The Maids’ Company that contained videos on cooking, housekeeping and soft skills, and was accessible to workers on their phones at any location. During placement, the Company ensured shuttle service/ travel allowance that covered women workers’ commute to client households; besides insisting on finite duration of shifts not extending into late night hours, the provision of drinking water and safe toilet facilities for women at work.

E0125-125-619,The potentially misleading nature of the use of stock photos in news reporting: A case in 2022 of the Russo-Ukrainian War,"The ability to transmit accurate information that does not deceive its readership, and the use of images that reflects the truth of the fact that they are supposed to be representing, should be an important principle and basal tenet of any traditional or social media-based news or journalistic organization or platform. It is not uncommon to find images or photos that accompany the text of a news article, and the visual impact of an image, as is often expressed in a cliché, can sometimes add much more value than merely the text itself. Whereas some fake news is patently untrue, another gray zone of journalism that is affected by fake news may encompass bias, spin and deceit. Absent rigorous quality control and editing measures, a news source may inadvertently slip into this gray zone, which encompasses the use of stock photos to represent, or supplement, the text of news items. Focusing on photos by a pro-Ukrainian social media app-based news media outlet, this rather unusual case involves a highly topical personality, the President of Ukraine. This article points to how subtle “truth” can change through the use (or abuse) of stock photos. Several images covering May-September of 2022, specifically photos or videos of an unshaven President Zelenskyy in military attire that switch to images of a shaven individual in a suit, and back again, are examined from a single Telegram-based news source. This case exemplifies, using a “soft” example, the risks of “massaging” truth using stock photos. In times of war, especially in the ongoing Russia-Ukrainian war, the accuracy of news, including the non-fictional imagery that accompanies it, is essential, so as to neither mislead nor bias the readership, and to portray the news as accurately and neutrally as possible.",2023-04-14T14:04:56.815829+00:00,"credibility,media manipulation,sensationalism,misleading news,clickbait,truth",,,Jaime A.

President Trump’s speech in Saudi Arabia was analyzed qualitatively according to Gee’s (2011) building tasks model. It has been found that President Trump enacts and builds the significance task by carefully selecting lexical items, cooperative patterns, lexical choice, and compliments. Furthermore, President Trump enacts particular identities and attributes specific identities to others in his speech, such as political, social, and cooperative identities. The analysis shows that President Trump shifts between the identities such as President of the U.S., a representative of the American People, a fighter and defender of American citizens and the world’s safety and security, a businessman, a well-educated and knowledgeable person.

This paper, based on data collected from approximately one-quarter of the workforce in an English police force (weighted n~876) addresses this gap. In the survey, respondents described their personal characteristics, colleague experience of victimisation and their personal experience of victimisation. From this, weighting the data to address non-response patterns, we found that the lifetime prevalence of domestic abuse in the police workforce was 22%. Females were more likely than males to be victims of domestic abuse (relative risk (RR) 1.61, confidence interval (CI) 1.25-2.08). Of victims, 47% disclosed their victimisation to a colleague, while 37% disclosed to a line manager and 27% were abused by a partner who also worked in policing. Although there was no difference in disclosure between males and females, disclosure to a colleague (RR 1.66, CI 1.24-2.13) or a line manager (RR 1.79, CI 1.24-2.58) was more likely if the abuse was perpetrated by a police member than by someone of a different occupation. This paper – the most comprehensive description of domestic abuse victimisation in a policing population – demonstrates that, despite their occupational role as guardians and enforcers of the law, the police workforce experience domestic abuse in similar ways as do the general population. As with the general population, this frequency of victimisation, coupled with the repetitive and continuous nature of domestic abuse and the harm it causes, represents a widespread problem and threat to the wellbeing of the police workforce.",2022-10-14T22:05:25.688049+00:00,"domestic abuse,police-perpetrated crime,victimisation,policing",,,"Leticia Couto, Iain Brennan, Nicola O'Leary",socarxiv
E00D6-F3E-2E7,A Critical Discourse Analysis of a Selected Non-Governmental Organizations’ Report on Violence against Women in Iraq,"Violence against women stands as one of the most dominant human rights violations. There are no social, economic, or national boundaries when it comes to violence against women. It is estimated that one in three women in the world will experience physical or sexual abuse at some point in their lives. Several non-governmental organizations’ reports have addressed the problem of violence against women in Iraq. Thus; the current study provides a critical analysis of the discursive techniques that are employed in the non-governmental organizations’ reports to show how Iraqi women are abused and subject to violence. Consequently; this study focuses on the linguistic and ideological underpinnings of a selected text on violence against women in Iraq. It attempts to show how language produces and maintains domination and abuse of power, engendering injustice, inequality, and ideological viewpoints. To answer this, the researchers draw upon van Dijk’s (2011) socio-cognitive approach and (2000) ideological analysis. The findings of the study have revealed that the non-governmental organizations’ report attempts to reflect the ideological position of the non-governmental organizations towards the Iraqi government, which declared its rejection of violence against women through its constitution and Panel Code. Despite this, the researchers have found that there is no actual adoption of these provisions in reality in its social context. Accordingly; the report has depended heavily on authority and evidentiality to show power relations and through the construction of reality based on societal perspectives. Using the linguistic and discoursal strategies employed in the analysis; the researchers have found that the report has materialized a negative attitude towards the government and society by referring to the power dominance which is exercised by social groups",2022-10-21T12:41:49.748926+00:00,"critical discourse analysis,power relation,ideology,ngos report,violence against women",,,"Sawsan Kareem Zghayyir Al-Saaidi, Isra’a Raheem Abdul-Hussain",socarxiv
E01B7-240-811,Why Is Trading So Important in Cap and Trade? The Role of Economies of Scale and Productivity,"Economists have long established the cost effectiveness of cap and trade (CAT) owing to the cost heterogeneity between firms. I offer a new value of CAT: cost reduction within firms owing to productivity improvement and economies of scale. Overcoming the unobserved-cost challenge, I extend the literature on production function and introduce a method to estimate economies of scale using data on output and input quantity. I combine this method with the difference-in-difference strategy to exploit the policy transition from non-tradable cap to cap and trade in Norwegian cod fishery to identify the causal impacts of trading fishing quotas. I find trading increased vessels' productivity and facilitated the realization of existing economies of scale: vessels acquired quotas, expanded their operation, and moved toward the minimum average cost levels. Vessels realized economies of scale by upgrading their sizes and going fishing more often. I decompose the output-based value of traded quotas and find economies of scale played a main role in the first few years after a big vessel acquired quotas. These results highlight (i) flexibility through tradability in environmental regulations can reduce production costs of a firm, (ii) cost reduction is gained by both boosting existing production factors and advancements beyond scale economies, and (iii) consolidation can be a sign of cost efficiency owing to economies of scale rather than market power abuse.",2022-10-23T20:22:15.947130+00:00,"fishery,production function,common resources,cap and trade,economies of scale,productivity",,,Phuong Ho,socarxiv

Eight coders coded the CPS intake reports from 2015 in a mid-sized urban county in the southeastern United States (N = 2,763). The averaged inter-rater reliability of the coding was high. We found that improper discipline/physical abuse was the most common domain of maltreatment (34.6%). Over 40% of these reports involved milder levels of abuse. Salient risk factors included caregiver drug use (20.6%) and domestic violence (19%). Our study suggests feasibility of developing a coding system to extract and assess child maltreatment intake narrative data.

E01FC-3F2-602,Queer Languages (that) matter: Navigating the role of Hijra Farsi in the gender and sexual identity formation of Khwaja Sara/Hijra’s in contemporary Pakistan,"Abstract This article examines the role of queer languages in the gender and sexual identity of LGBTIQ individuals. Existing scholarships demonstrate that research on queer languages is not very common and regularly practiced. In this way, this article first dissects and analyses the historical perspective, uniqueness, learning and speaking process of queer languages in the gay and lesbian communities and then explore Hijra Farsi in the communities of Khawaja Sara and Hijras in contemporary Pakistan. Considering the importance of queer language, the analysis in this article demonstrates that queer languages play an important role in the identity formation of LGBTIQ communities and express their freedom in ways as they understand their gender identity and sexual orientation. This critical analysis is an illustration of a qualitative research conducted in Peshawar city using in-depth face to face interview as research method with ten participants. The findings of this article try to demonstrate the data and to answer the question; how do queer language shape the identity of homosexuals across the globe and how do Hijra Farsi as queer language give them voices and recognition in contemporary Pakistan. Therefore, taking Hijra Farsi (A secret language of Khawaja Sara and Hijras) as a case of secret language, the findings show that Hijra Farsi has incredible importance in the living life of Khawaja Sara and Hijra because of their uniqueness and being a language that is not widely understood across the wider communities. Khawaja Sara and Hijras prefer to speak in Hijra Farsi to protect themselves from violence, abuse, kidnapping and oppression. The finding further show that Hijra Farsi has no written scripts and dialects, but it is easily understood in the communities of Khawaja Sara and Hijras, because it is spoken, learned, and thought in collaboration in the guru-cheela houses in Peshawar city. Polari is now an almost lost language since LGBQIT+ community has less fears in contemporary Europe, America, and Australia etc. But this paper highlights the importance of preserving Hijra Farsi and highlights the importance of putting serious efforts by giving it a documented shape so that it may not lost like Polari.

E00B7-CF4-40B,"Perceptions of policing among criminal defendants in San Jose, California","This report summarizes perceptions of policing among a racially and socio-economically diverse sample of 37 people who faced criminal charges in the Hall of Justice, a courthouse in San Jose, California, between August 2021 and March 2022. A majority of criminal defendants we interviewed reported negative perceptions of personal police treatment, but a considerable minority reported positive perceptions. Among those who reported negative perceptions, two criticisms were common: (1) individual police officers’ violence, abuse, and fabrication of evidence; and (2) systemic policing practices that are overly intrusive and estrange certain disfavored groups in the Bay Area, such as the unhoused. Among those who reported positive perceptions, some believe that, despite their personal experiences of positive treatment, police do not treat everyone fairly and policing quality varies by context and the race of the policed person. Alongside these perceptions, a handful of defendants in the sample offered visions for changing policing. Two notable visions were: (1) reallocating resources from police departments toward other city services or under-resourced groups; and (2) reforming police departments in ways that reduce discrimination and abuse. While we discuss variation along demographic characteristics in our sample, we foreground how the range of experiences and visions of policing in San Jose have implications for policymakers and future research.",2022-04-26T04:00:31.079940+00:00,"courts,criminal legal system,legal cynicism,legal envisioning,policing,race,criminal justice",,,"Sophia Hunt, Matthew Clair, Claudia Nmai",socarxiv

India, Burma, or the Philippines are notable examples of East Asian nations facing the trend of decreasing levels of liberal democracy. This paper investigates how democratic backsliding leads to authoritarianism and human rights abuses through quantitative analysis. In addition, this paper investigates how a new authoritarian East Asian order enables further democratic backsliding and human rights abuses. Through this analysis, I concluded that countries who experience democratic backsliding often devolve into authoritarian states that violate human rights to retain their status quo.

E00CA-37C-07E,The Role of Adults in Protecting Children (A Theory of Change for the Primary Prevention of Child Sexual Abuse),"Child sexual abuse (CSA) is a pervasive public health issue impacting physical, mental, and behavioral health outcomes across the lifespan; however, many programs focus heavily on response rather than prevention strategies. They also lack grounding in a common theoretical model for CSA prevention. This manuscript introduces a Theory of Change (ToC) for Adult Prevention of CSA that utilizes a Social Behavior Change approach. This theory identifies individual and contextual factors that address the complexity of CSA prevention, depicted in a social-ecological model. The ToC was developed using a scoping literature review, semi-structured interviews with stakeholders (N=27), and a community engagement survey (N=183). The ToC maps a series of causal pathways for prevention among four adult groups and is an important tool for stakeholders working in child protection since it supports program design, advocacy initiatives, and training programs. It is expected that the ToC will contribute to broader discourse on best practices for CSA prevention.",2022-05-11T02:38:51.651329+00:00,"sexual violence against children and adolescents,sexual abuse prevention,child sexual abuse,social and behavior change,theory of change,childhood sexual exploitation",,,"Gwendolyn S.

E00D9-669-228,Proposal for Policy Change in the procedure of civil asset forfeiture,"Without the proper due process, the civil asset forfeiture procedure violates the Constitutional rights of citizens. The proposal aims to address the current right granted to the police to seize the property of civilians. The authorizing laws established by the Assets Forfeiture Fund and the Equitable Sharing Program are problematic by offering a loophole for the abuse of the property rights of American citizens. While some states have abolished the practice, federal laws still support their enforcement. The deficiencies in the policies raise discussions on the issue of policies for profit as the major aspect of civil asset forfeiture. The proposal is to outlaw instances of civil asset forfeiture without due process on the federal level. On the state level, the preferred outcome would also include reform by repealing the laws allowing property seizure. The resistance to change in the legislature should be addressed by securing the success of the policy, taking advantage of the current unpopularity of unregulated asset forfeiture, and creating the base for the process integration on the federal level. The proposal calls for identifying stakeholders, analyzing their views, and strengthening their support. The social and political opposition should be addressed by putting emphasis on fundamental American values. The action plan and implementation process are built upon efficient communication by the policy committee to engage stakeholders and the wider public in the process. With clearly defined priorities and budget allocation, the policy will ultimately evolve into a legislative and organizational tool. Using the strategies of ascertainment of stakeholders and reframing issues to ensure appeal to American values, the change on federal and state levels will be achievable. While the change will lead to debate, significant improvement is attainable in due process and the protection of rights.",2022-11-17T17:10:43.984567+00:00,"fundamental civil liberties,asset forfeiture legislation,american law enforcement,civil forfeit policy",,,Nikolaos Tzenios,socarxiv
E004A-A4D-BE8,Online Disinformation and Harmful Speech: Dangers for Democratic Participation and Possible Policy Responses,"In advance of the 2019 federal election, the Canadian government began to address challenges posed by posed by new digital technologies and the rapidly-evolving information system. These policy responses include revisions to Canada’s election law and the creation of a federal task force to monitor and respond to online interference during an election campaign. However, much can still be done to uphold the communications element of electoral integrity, both by government and by other stakeholders including journalists, social media companies, and civil society organizations. This article focusses on two related challenges: disinformation and harmful speech online. By ‘‘disinformation,” we refer to intentionally false or deceptive communication to advance political ends. We use the term ‘‘harmful speech” to refer to communication that is abusive, threatening, denigrating, or that incites violence. We clarify the risks that disinformation and harmful speech pose to democratic engagement and democratic processes, and synthesize current research about their creation, circulation, and political impacts. We then examine the current regulatory context in Canada (at the time of writing, February 1, 2019) and highlight gaps. We conclude with policy recommendations that would enable the Canadian government, social media platforms and journalism organizations to better understand and reduce the threats to democracy posed by disinformation and harmful speech. These are partly drawn from policies that other countries are pursuing. We call for a three-pronged policy framework: 1) greater enforcement of existing laws, 2) regulation to encourage and help social media platforms address abuses; and 3) improved civil society measures, especially by journalism organizations.

E0031-102-95A,Childhood circumstances shape multimorbidity and functional limitation in the old age in England: a life course pathway model,"The study presents a pathway model of the risk of multimorbidity and functional limitation from childhood to old age. Childhood circumstances, measured as parents’ social class, adverse experiences and child’s health, influenced multimorbidity and functional limitation at old age indirectly via material, psychosocial and behavioural pathways. These pathways acted as magnifiers of early inequalities: they enhanced the unequal impacts of the pre-existing differences between individuals in socio-economic position, psychological connections and health. The pathway effects measured at age 50-64 years were larger than the total effects of childhood social class, adverse experiences and child’s health. Thus pre-retirement appears to be an important period for the health of ageing adults in England. However, in people suffering from complex multimorbidity the total effect of the adverse experiences of abuse and family dysfunction in childhood surpassed the effect of adult psychosocial circumstances. This suggests an early-life sensitive period for this outcome. The strength of the paper is that childhood circumstances were approached from a broader angle than the usual focus on either the material conditions or extreme experiences of children. The framework is based on a complex mediation analysis with both parallel and serial mediators where the SEM framework with latent factors is an excellent tool to handle multiple regression relationships and measurement error.",2021-09-30T17:22:03.994400+00:00,"structural equation model,complex multimorbidity,multimorbidity,functional limitations,childhood circumstances,life course pathways,mediation",,,Leo Singer,socarxiv

Casely Hayford of the Gold Coast (Ghana). It exposes Blyden’s ideas, a philosophy on Africans physical and intellectual emancipation, and points out the similarities in the thought of both men. Blyden toured different parts of West Africa and spoke with great intensity about the African problem and ways of its remedy. His ideas had a lot of influence at the time and precipitated the emergence of nationalist messiah who undertook a mission to redefine the African universe. This study examines the ideas and intellect of J.E.Casely Hayford and revealed that his thoughts were a potency of Edward Wilmot Blyden’s philosophy. An examination of his ideas reveals how Joseph Ephraim Casely Hayford took an uncompromising stand against the derogatory and the glaring abuses of European colonialism. He shaped cultural nationalism that disdained the apparent repulsive and despotic colonial hegemony and fashioned a new outlook for fellow Africans to stand up as humans. This article concludes that Hayford, drawing on Blyden’s philosophy, succeeded in fashioning a culture of protest against all forms of black degradation and thus presented a continuity in black political thought that remained up to present.",2020-06-18T01:42:41.887484+00:00,"african problem,casely hayford,european colonialism,cultural nationalism edward wilmot blyden",,,"Ahmed Bouchemal, Faiza Meberbeche Senouci",socarxiv

Methods: Using data on monthly count of arrest for controlling or coercive behaviour in 33 police forces, we used a negative binomial difference-in-difference analysis and capitalised on differences in intervention timing to undertake an event study. Results: Training was associated with a 41% increase in arrest for controlling or coercive behaviour for trained forces compared to untrained forces (IRR 1.413, 95% CI 1.235–1.617). The event study illustrated that the increase in arrests in trained forces was consistent with the timing of the training. Conclusions: Training entire police forces to understand the dynamics of domestic abuse, including the new offence of coercive control, is effective in increasing the rate of arrest for coercive control.",2020-07-14T07:05:33.142228+00:00,"difference-in-differences,domestic abuse,coercive control,event study,policing,police training",,,"Jacki Tapley, Giulia Tagliaferri, Iain Brennan, Andy Myhill",socarxiv

There is little research comparing how these two types of laws affect drug consumption of the general US population. Using a difference in difference strategy, we find that recreational laws increase past-year marijuana use by 25% among adults and by 10% among adolescents. In contrast, medical laws increase adult use by only 5% and have a negligible effect on adolescent use. We also find that recreational marijuana dispensaries are an important driver of the increase in marijuana use for adults 26 and over. Taken together, our results suggest that medical laws are not de facto recreational laws in that they succeed in mitigating recreational use, that recreational laws have broad effects on overall levels of marijuana use, and that underage marijuana use may be an important problem with existing implementations of recreational marijuana laws.",2020-08-19T10:15:46.289144+00:00,"marijuana legalization,adolescent drug use,medical marijuana,substance abuse,recreational marijuana",,,"Alex Hollingsworth, Coady Wing, Ashley Bradford",socarxiv

The four cultural values discussed may be foundational to the translation and interpretation of the Bible, which may have been transmitted through various mediums. The culture-infused religious community may be activated to utilize various tactics potentially to establish and maintain power and control over others. This information can help explore possible systemic impacts on client systems.

E0178-B67-521,"The Legal Design of Domestic MLA procedures in Southeast Europe: A Comparative Analysis of Serbia, North Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina","The chapter explores the domestic legal design of Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) procedures, analysing individual forms of MLA such as extradition of suspects or convicts, takeover or surrender of prosecution, and execution of foreign judgments. The analysis compares legislation from three countries in Southeast Europe: Serbia, North Macedonia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. It examines whether two key components of legal design, namely (i) the discretion granted to institutions within the criminal justice system and political establishment and (ii) the presence of checks and balances systems within MLA procedures, have a positive or negative impact on MLA policy in practice. The analysis reveals that, although the three countries share many similarities in their legal arrangements pertaining to MLA procedures, there are some variations in specific forms of MLA, in terms of the discretion granted to domestic actors and the presence of checks and balances within the procedure. The findings show that significant discretion given to specific actors within the MLA policy can pave the way for harmful practices such as arbitrariness, uneven application of the law, and potential political abuse. The study also highlights the value of incorporating built-in checks and balances within the MLA procedure to ensure accountability and mutual control mechanisms, confirming that, where such mechanisms are not present, appropriate accountability and control safeguards are missing, enabling potential abuse of power or neglect in handling the MLA procedure. At the same time, it emerges that these checks and balances, whether they include internal review mechanisms, joint decision-making models, and/or approval powers ('de facto vetoing'), should not be excessive or burdensome to avoid obstructing the MLA processes.",2023-09-21T22:48:42.366159+00:00,"mutual legal assistance (mla),western balkans,checks and balances,legal design,regulatory discretion",,,"Slobodan Tomic, Elizabeth David-Barrett",socarxiv
E013B-E44-115,How to co-create content moderation policies: The case of the AutSPACEs project,"The moderation of user-generated content on online platforms remains a key solution to protecting people online, but also remains a perpetual challenge as the appropriateness of content moderation guidelines depends on the online community that they aim to govern. This challenge affects marginalised groups in particular, as they more frequently experience online abuse but also end up falsely being the target of content-moderation guidelines. While there have been calls for democratic, community-moderation, there has so far been little research into how to implement such approaches. Here, we present the co-creation of content moderation strategies with the users of an online platform to address some of these challenges. Within the context of AutSPACEs – an online citizen science platform that aims to allow autistic people to share their own sensory processing experiences publicly – we used a community-based and participatory approach to co-design a content moderation solution that would fit the preferences, priorities and needs of its autistic user community. We outline how this approach helped us discover context-specific moderation dilemmas around participant safety and wellbeing and how we addressed those. These trade-offs have resulted in a moderation design that differs from more general social networks in aspects such as how to contribute, when to moderate, and what to moderate. While these dilemmas, processes and solutions are specific to the context of AutSPACEs, we highlight how the co-design approach itself could be applied and useful for other communities to uncover challenges and help other online spaces to embed safety and empowerment.",2023-07-13T09:46:32.983040+00:00,"social networks,co-design,autism,content moderation,citizen science",,,"Susanna Fantoni, Robin Taylor, Georgia Aitkenhead, Callum Mole, Otis Smith, Kirstie Whitaker, James Scott, Martin Stoffel, Bastian Greshake Tzovaras, Helen Duncan, David Llewellyn-Jones, Sophia Batchelor",socarxiv
E00F0-836-F0E,How do Climate Change and Environmental Degradation contribute to Violence against Children?,"This scoping review of the literature explores the interlinkages between two pressing crises: violence against children (VAC) and climate change (CC) together with environmental degradation (ED). Only recently have research and policy begun to shine a light on the magnifying effect of CC on children’s exposure to violence, exploitation, and abuse, with the role of ED remaining under-explored. To spur academic and political movement in this area, our research aims to help establish the magnitude, direction, and pathways of the relationship between CC, ED, and VAC.

E0154-897-444,Is there a risk of APC-driven guest authorship?,"While guest or honorary authorship on academic papers is a broadly and widely discussed phenomenon in biomedical research, the issue of the use – or abuse – of article processing charges (APCs) as a form of potential authorship exchange currency, i.e., the “APC ring”, is not being discussed. The APC is central to the open access (OA) movement, specifically gold OA, including hybrid subscription models. It is conceivable that poorly-funded researchers aiming to publish in ranked (e.g., with a Clarivate journal impact factor or indexed in a major database such as Scopus) OA journals with expensive APCs (sometimes costing thousands of US dollars or Euros) might turn to richer researchers to foot the bill in exchange for authorship. Despite this, extensive web and database searches revealed no published cases on APC-for-authorship schemes as a form of guest authorship, which seems inconceivable. One possible explanation is that if such unethical behavior, and a form of fraud, were to be detected by APC-charging journals, that it might not be reported as such. Alternatively, if it has been detected as such, it might be reported (e.g., to the public) more broadly as “authorship issues” without detailing that an APC-based guest authorship scheme (i.e., “APC ring”) was involved. In such a situation, APC-dependent journals would be conflicted between receiving a financial lifeline, the APC, and exposing authors that abuse the APC in exchange for authorship. How would OA publishers justify receiving APCs derived from an “APC ring”? Although this form of guest authorship is currently hypothetical, it is also highly likely, so this issue needs greater debate. If actual case studies exist, these need to be openly and publicly debated to better appreciate how widely this phenomenon may be taking place.",2023-05-13T21:58:49.630593+00:00,"open access,article processing charge,opacity versus transparency,funding,honorary authorship",,,Jaime A.

E014B-660-ECE,The Publicization of Organizational Misconduct: A Social Structural Approach,"Scandals are momentous events with far-reaching consequences for organizations and society, but we still know relatively little about the contextual conditions that enable them. In this paper, we develop and test a theory of the publicization of organizational misconduct: that is, of how an act of wrongdoing by an organization becomes widely publicized—thereby giving rise to a scandal—or receives little coverage, with little or no consequence for the offending organization. We argue that communities have structural features that affect the social cost of making information public as well as its dissemination, shaping the likelihood of organizational misconduct being publicized in the process. We test and find evidence in support of our arguments using data on sex abuse in the U.S. Catholic Church between 1980 and 2010 and exploring the heterogeneity in the publicization of patterns of misconduct by Catholic clergy across dioceses and over time. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for the scholarly understanding of organizational misconduct and scandals across settings.",2023-07-01T12:07:53.726220+00:00,"catholic church,publicization,embeddedness,social structure,community,misconduct",,,"Julien Jourdan, Alessandro Piazza",socarxiv
E015F-AF6-CF4,Bruising in non-mobile infants: Challenging assumptions and reassessing the evidence,"This paper demonstrates that the assumption of accidental bruising in non-mobile infants being rare is not supported by research. It highlights weaknesses in the evidence-base and shows that between 0.6% and 5.3% of non-mobile children had a bruise on a single observation and 27% had a bruise over an average of 7.6 weekly observations in a longitudinal study. Thus between 1,960 and 17,300 infants had an accidental bruise on any one day compared to 410 child protection plans starting a year for infants because of physical abuse. Moreover, research shows the lack of an explanation from a parent, or changing explanations, does not necessarily indicate guilt. The paper reviews local authority procedures produced by safeguarding partnerships. These misinterpret research and sometimes contradict it, whilst exaggerating the likelihood that a bruise is non-accidental. Procedures differed in their interpretation of when a child is premobile and the actions that safeguarding staff should take; further, a quarter did not comply with legal requirements in “Working Together” mandating either a strategy discussion (28 procedures) or a Section 47 investigation (7 procedures) in all cases of bruises in children under 6-months-old. Finally, the paper considers the impact of this upon parents, and the implications for legal decision-making.",2023-10-20T01:42:05.833581+00:00,"infants,abuse,non-mobile,premobile,child protection,physical maltreatment,bruise",,,"Andy Bilson, Charlotte Image Flower",socarxiv

E00F4-4BD-E4E,Minorities’ Views on Freedom of Expression: Unrestricted or Protective?,"While freedom of expression is a key principle of democracy, normative theories do not provide a univocal answer about its potential limits. Two major normative views stand on this respect. The first one advocates for few or no freedom of speech limits, while the contrasting view argues in favor of establishing clear limits as a way to protect some groups or individuals. What makes an individual more prone to embrace an unrestricted (liberal) or a restrained (protective) view remains an unsolved matter. Moreover, existing research predominantly focuses on the general public and majorities, the ones who have to decide whether or not to restrain their speech to protect vulnerable individuals and groups. Instead, minorities’ views on the trade-off between protection and freedom of speech remain unexplored, even if minorities are a frequent target of offensive speech. In this article we test the impact of hate speech on attitudes towards freedom of speech among European Muslims. For this purpose, we exploit an unexpected event occurred during the fieldwork of the European Social Survey. Specifically, we track the effects of the release of the ``Innocence of Muslims'', a short film that denigrates Islamic prophet Muhammad, on Muslims' views on freedom of speech. Our findings reveal a shift towards a more protective stance on freedom of expression among Muslims in response to exposure to abusive speech directed towards their in-group. After being targeted through hate speech Muslims became much more open to establishing clear limits and boundaries on free speech. These results have relevant implications for current debates about the limits of free speech, and call for more attention to the reaction of minority groups that are often targeted through hate speech.",2023-12-15T21:47:47.021179+00:00,"free speech,europe,political culture,public opinion,unexpected event,survey,minorities",,,"Monica Ferrin, Carol Galais, Enrique Hernández",socarxiv

Access to justice is a vital right that ensures all other rights can be upheld. This study investigates how national lockdown affected the operation of family courts and children’s access to justice in Morocco. National lockdowns were enforced between March 21th and June 10th 2020 in response to the spread of coronavirus. The general closure of civil society was not extended to the judicial system and family courts were expected to continue operating and provide access to protection and justice. How well the court system mentioned to function under the constraints of stay-at-home orders is an open question. To investigate the impact of the national COVID-19 lockdown on family court systems and access to justice for children in Morocco this study used publicly available court filings (N= 77,335) pertaining to child abuse and neglect from 1st January 2020 to 30th December 2020 spanning the pre-lockdown, lockdown, and post-lockdown periods. Interrupted time series analysis was conducted to assess the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on court filing outcomes across different case types including penal, civil, complaints, and reports at the national, regional, and court level, controlling for time trends and regional fixed effects. National lockdowns were associated with decrease in cases filed and an increase in the percentages of cases with delays. Average case length differed by case type. Post-lockdown, case numbers recovered however there was large weekly variation likely due to rolling regional lockdowns.

The direct and indirect victimisation of the racialised ‘other’ on the Eastern border of the Union is a direct extension of the EU-sponsored war on its Member States’ former colonial nationals and other racialized passport-poor in the Mediterranean. Together, the two form one clear and coherent picture of fragrant mass rights abuse. This EU law approach has claimed more than 25,000 lives over the last eight years and left more than 100,000 innocent people captured and imprisoned, or enslaved and sold for ransom by the criminal proxies enlisted by the EU and its Member States. This dramatic situation has not arisen by chance. In this paper we show that an array of legal techniques is deployed by the European Union, specifically by FRONTEX, the European Commission and, to some extent, by the European Court of Justice – to make sure that the full extent of the denial of the right to life and other vital rights of non-citizens is never presented as a violation of EU law. We call these legal techniques EU lawlessness law. Focusing on the situation at the EU–Belarusian border allows us to zoom in on the bespoke lawlessness solutions crafted and deployed by the EU there. The gross violations of the law are rhetorically justified by the alleged instrumentalisation of migrants by the dictatorial Belarusian regime, which emerges as a de facto partner of the EU and its Member States in torturing numerous people in complete disregard of any of the legal guarantees that the Union professes to provide.",2023-12-11T15:28:52.048879+00:00,,,,"Sarah Ganty, Dimitry Vladimirovich Kochenov, Aleksandra Jolkina",socarxiv

Bangladesh has a diversified population made up of several ethnic and religious groupings, however, these groups are frequently victims of violence and prejudice. The study will look into the core causes of such violence as well as the constitutional protections in place to protect the rights of this minority. A qualitative method will be used in the research, which will include a review of current literature, case studies, and interviews with experts in the subject. The study's findings show that, notwithstanding constitutional protections protecting the rights of ethnic and religious minorities, there are major gaps in their implementation. Minority groups are frequently subjected to discrimination in education, employment, and other fundamental rights. Both state and non-state entities frequently commit violence against them with impunity. The study also stresses the need for legislative reforms and policy improvements to remedy gaps in minority rights protection. The document suggests that organizations responsible for preserving minority rights, such as the National Human Rights Commission, be strengthened, and that minority groups be included in decision-making processes. The research findings will have ramifications for governments, civil society groups, and human rights campaigners in Bangladesh and other nations dealing with comparable concerns. The study will also contribute to the scholarly literature on human rights violations and minority rights protection in Bangladesh. Overall, this research paper will be a helpful resource for anybody interested in learning about the issues that ethnic and religious minorities confront in Bangladesh, as well as the efforts that must be taken to defend their rights.",2024-01-05T01:35:08.225597+00:00,"ethnic,religious minority,violence,minority",,,"Israt Alam Raka, Muhammed Atiqur Rahman",socarxiv
E015F-6D9-E5C,"Derogations, Democratic Backsliding, and International Human Rights During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Did states misuse international legal emergency provisions during the COVID-19 pandemic to justify human rights abuse or did they follow international human rights law? Many governments restricted citizens’ freedom of movement, association, and assembly during the crisis, raising questions about states’ commitments to international human rights law. Some states used derogations to communicate temporary suspension of international legal provisions in a proportional and non-discriminatory manner, while others did not. We explore the dynamics of democratic backsliding and derogation use during the pandemic. We find that backsliding states were more likely to issue human rights treaty derogations. These derogations had mitigating effects once issued. Backsliding states that issued derogations were more likely to communicate restrictions and were less likely to issue abusive and discriminatory policy during the pandemic. Derogations helped temper abuse in states not experiencing backsliding. However, derogations did not always protect against abuse and media transparency in backsliding states. These results lend support to the use of flexibility mechanisms in international law and find that most states did not use emergency derogations to heighten human rights violations. The study contributes to the understanding of how international legal measures may help mitigate elements of democratic backsliding during times of crisis.",2024-07-25T09:31:35.311061+00:00,"human rights,democratic backsliding,derogation,pandemic,international law",,,"Suparna Chaudhry, Audrey L.

E01E7-DDF-724,Measuring and Controlling Subway Fare Evasion: Improving Safety and Security at New York City Transit Authority,"New York City Transit (NYCT) has a comprehensive framework for assessing, managing, and combating subway fare evasion. The automated fare collection (AFC) system, implemented 1994~97, features lessons learned from field trials of prototypes specifically designed to limit fare abuse. Subway crime has decreased 68% since 2000, and annual average subway evasion rate remains low at approximately 1.3%. Today, the Authority measures fare evasion with independent silent observers using stratified random sampling techniques, classifying passenger entries into 19 categories. Evasion rate peaks at 3pm due to students dismissal, otherwise hovers around 0.9% peak, 1.9% off-peak. Busy times and locations have higher evasions per hour but lower evasions per passenger. More evasions occur in lower-income neighbourhoods. Staff presence apparently doesn’t reduce evasions. Results are released to the press on request, promoting transparency and accountability. To combat evasion, NYCT increased fines from 60 to 100 U.S. dollars in 2008. Police issued 68,000 summonses and made 19,000 evasion arrests in 2009. Arrests are a more effective deterrent than summonses; the proportion of arrests versus summonses increased in 2010.

We then methodically identify various themes that outline ways in which pornography may play a complex role in child sexual abuse.

E00C6-5AE-2C6,The social categorization of sexual abuse,"In our minds, what exactly counts as child sexual abuse? Who do we consider as people who commit such acts? What do we associate with the risk of sexual abuse? Who do we consider dangerous? Who do we blame? Are all sexual abuse victims seen as deserving of help, or are some victims seen as less deserving? Is there a hierarchy of victims? Does it matter whether we believe them? How does our behavior toward victims impact them? These are all questions explored in this thesis. Aiming to conceptualize and explain public perceptions of child sexual abuse and the observable implications of these perceptions, this thesis drew on three qualitative studies focusing on victims, parents, and the general public. This thesis introduces novel perspectives on how society views and reacts to sexual abuse, blending insights from sociology, law, victimology, criminology, and psychology. It reveals that abuse is more likely recognized when it visibly resembles a crime, like when there is evident violence or injury. Most importantly, the social “understanding” of what constitutes sexual abuse is far more limiting than what the law describes as such. Offenders are typically portrayed as somehow different from the rest of the population and victims are judged against the “ideal victim” stereotype – i.e., young, innocent, visibly traumatized children. Teenagers or those seen as risk-takers are often viewed as less harmed, a notion rooted in conditional harmfulness, inaccurately judging abuse impact based on victim attributes. Overall, in people’s perceptions, the “child” in child sexual abuse rarely includes teenagers. These perceptions deeply affect responses to abuse, influencing the support and belief extended to victims. Those fitting the “ideal victim” mold receive empathy and are urged to report abuse, while those who do not, are usually shamed and discouraged from seeking help. Ultimately, the thesis reveals how societal “stories” about sexual abuse create a framework that influences everything from social categorization of sexual abuse to victims’ self-perceptions and post-abuse behavior. It highlights the challenges victims face, not just in dealing with the abuse but also in navigating the societal expectations and judgments that come with it. The thesis concludes with practical recommendations and suggestions for future research.",2024-05-01T12:10:07.904119+00:00,"victim stereotypes,online risks,sexual abuse,ideal victim,qualitative study,child sexual abuse,discourse,online sexual risk,discursive psychology,sexual violence,risk perception",,,Simone Eelmaa,socarxiv

E01FB-340-210,The Effects of Unconditional Cash Transfers on Child Abuse and Neglect in Early Childhood: Evidence from New Zealand,"Background Child abuse and neglect are found at higher rates in families with low incomes, and in contexts with lower public spending on families. However, it is not clear whether modest cash transfers could reduce rates. Objective To know the effects of unconditional cash transfers to mothers with children under 3 years of age on child abuse and neglect. Setting and Participants In 2018, New Zealand - an ethnically diverse rich democracy with above average child poverty - introduced a ""Families Package"" of largely unconditional cash transfers for mothers of children aged 0-3. The majority of the package comprised a universal payment for children aged 0-1 of NZ$60 (US$37) a week, and a payment of up to that amount for families in all but the top third of incomes for children aged 1-3. Mothers chose whether to receive payments weekly, monthly or annually. We use administrative data for all children born in New Zealand between 2013 and 2019 (N=172,170). Method Difference-in-difference estimation compared the difference in child abuse and neglect for 3-year-olds born before and after the introduction of the Families Package in July 2018, with the differences between the same birth month periods for children born in the previous 3 years. Results The Families Package reduced child protective services’ referrals to family services in non- urgent cases of suspected maltreatment by 19% overall (OR: 0.81, CI: 0.80-0.81, p=0.003), and by 26% (OR: 0.74, CI: 0.61-0.91, p=0.003) for M ̄aori, the indigenous people. It also reduced substantiated cases of neglect in single mother families (OR 0.6, CI 0.38 - 0.93, p=0.022). There were no significant effects on urgent cases, substantiations of physical or emotional abuse, or hospitalizations for traumatic brain injuries.

E010D-85C-DDE,*READ**THIS*!! Spam as a Threat for Open Science,"Drawing on multiple sources of qualitative data, I describe a case of open science infrastructure (OSI) abuse. The case illustrates how developers navigated schol- arly values and issues of epistemic and platform legitimacy while battling spam on their open science webapp. Notably, their struggle used precious financial resources and drew attention away from other development tasks like feature expansion.

E01A0-B54-2A1,Pandemic Pass? Treaty Derogations and Human Rights Practices During COVID-19,"This research note asks whether states issuing pandemic-era human rights treaty derogations implemented emergency provisions as intended or used them to abuse human rights during a time of crisis. In an effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries declared states of emergency and derogated (temporarily suspended) from their international human rights treaty obligations. Using data from the Varieties of Democracy PanDem dataset and the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker, we find that states that derogated from their international human rights obligations imposed emergency measures that were temporary and did not violate non-derogable rights. On the other hand, states that did not derogate were more likely impose discriminatory measures, enact emergency measures without time limits and violate non-derogable rights. Our results support the role that flexibility mechanisms such as derogations play in international law and show that states are being sincere about their intentions and not, generally, using these mechanisms to cover abusive behavior.",2024-07-25T09:32:04.006555+00:00,"treaty derogations,human rights,emergency policies,covid-19",,,"Audrey L.

E01BF-784-4DF,Unveiling Strategic Governance and User Dynamics in Weibo's Community-driven Content Moderation System,"Social media companies continuously experiment with various platform governance models to tackle content moderation challenges, which calls for a comprehensive and empirical understanding of how a content moderation system evolves over the long term. Our study aims to fill this gap through a quantitative and qualitative study of Weibo's community-driven content moderation system, leveraging eleven million public moderation cases and decision data from 2012 to 2021. Based on reporting activities, platform decisions, and jury actions, we investigated the motivations and behavior patterns of three important actors in this governance model: reporting users, the platform, and user jurors. We suggest that users who frequently reported content and initiated the community-driven content moderation process tend to exhibit patterns of voluntarily policing the community or abusing others, sometimes coordinately, and were also treated differently by the platform. We indicate that Weibo's strategic moderation decisions have significantly distinctive preferences over cases from various topic categories and different levels of harmfulness, and the cases involving socially sensitive issues were given more consideration and penalized more severely than common misbehaviors. We also explore how the platform leveraged the usually one-sided votes of digital jurors to endorse its final decisions and find that the reason notes given by crowdsourced jurors also revealed a serious issue of decaying motivation. Our findings offer important insights into the coordination between a social media platform and its volunteer moderators to moderate an online community and address the question of how an autonomic platform governance model can prevail or perish.",2025-04-12,"Content Moderation,Digital Jury,Platform Governance,Social Media,Weibo",,,"Haohan Lily Hu, Andy Zhao",socarxiv
E0145-ED1-29C,Parental involvement and depressive symptoms among adolescents,"Adolescent depression is an increasingly important problem in modern society. One of the key determinants of adolescent depression is parental involvement. It has been established that parental involvement and high-quality parent-child relationships play a protective role in psychosocial well-being of children while parental neglect and abuse are risk factors for depression. However, different forms of parental involvement might have different effects on children’s psychological well-being. In particular, some kinds of parental control may have adverse effects. In this paper, we study the association between parental control and positive parental involvement with depression using survey data of middle and high school students from a Russian region (N = 1364). We find that, independently, all forms of parental involvement are negatively associated with depression. However, only positive involvement is a protective factor against depression, while parental control is not associated with depression after controlling for the other forms of parental involvement. These results could be used in developing prevention and education programs for parents.",2021-11-20,"adolescence,depression,parental control,parental involvement,protective factors",,,"Ksenia Pavlenko, Alexandra Bochaver, Elizaveta Sivak, Ivan Smirnov",socarxiv

E01D2-E88-572,The Feasibility of National Inference Under the NSCAW IV L-State Sample Design,"The purpose of this Feasibility Analysis Study (FAS) was to evaluate methods for producing valid national estimates under the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-being (NSCAW) IV sample design. The NSCAW IV design is a stratified two-stage, unequal probability design that restricts the sample to within L purposively selected states, where L is a number between 8 and 12. (L = 10 was assumed for most the analyses in this document). The design is fully consistent with the NSCAW IV’s primary objective (i.e., to provide detailed, precise state-level estimates for the L key states selected for the survey). However, an important secondary objective is to provide for valid national estimates, even though the sample design itself is not nationally representative. The FAS was conducted to determine whether the NSCAW IV L-state design could achieve this secondary objective. FAS confirmed that national estimates are indeed feasible. This report provides a summary of the FAS results and offers detailed, statistical evidence as to the NSCAW IV L-state design’s ability to produce valid national inferences. State estimates can be produced from the NSCAW IV design by applying classical survey estimation techniques; however, national estimation requires nonprobability or so-called quasi-random estimation and modeling techniques. The FAS investigated two such estimation approaches: quasi-randomization weighting (QRW) and superpopulation modeling (SPM). Data from prior NSCAW cohorts—NSCAW I and II—were analyzed to simulate the NSCAW IV design. Fortunately, the NSCAW I and II designs are quite similar to what is proposed for NSCAW IV in that they both include a purposive selection of states—L = 8, in total. The key difference between their designs and NSCAW IV’s design is that the two prior surveys also included a random sample the “remainder” stratum (i.e., the combination of states that were not purposively selected). This remainder stratum provided for the unbiased national estimation in NSCAW I and II without the needed for nonprobability estimation approaches. However, the remainder stratum was initially ignored in application of the QRW and SPM to NSCAW I and II states to simulate the NSCAW IV design. Later in the analysis, the remainder stratum provided a mechanism to assessing the biases in the QRW and SPM national estimates. This was critical in order for the FAS analysis speculate on the potential bias risks for NSCAW IV national estimates using the sample estimation approaches. As the results in the report convincingly show, both the QRW and SPM approaches are capable of producing valid national estimates from the L-state design envisioned for NSCAW IV. QRW is recommended for the estimating the means of the vast majority of questionnaire characteristics; however, in situations where QRW may fail to produce accurate results, the SPM approach can then be implemented to produce more accurate results. One drawback of SPM is that it requires more effort and a higher level of statistical expertise to implement. The research reported in this document initially addresses the question of whether the QRW method can be feasibly applied to the NSCAW IV data to obtain valid national inferences based on a small number (8 ≤ L ≤ 12) of purposively selected sample of states. Variations of QRW were applied to the NSCAW I eight-state sample and then, using the combination of the state and remainder stratum samples, the quality of the QRW national estimates was evaluated by comparing them to the full sample, unbiased national estimates. A number of key quality indicators were analyzed for national estimates related to 26 NSCAW characteristics—23 variables that overlap with the NCANDS data and three Child Behavior Check List (CBCL) characteristics from the survey questionnaire. Four types of estimates based solely on the eight-state data were computed: (1) unweighted estimates, (2) estimates based on the unadjusted NSCAW weights, (3) estimates derived from Method 1 weighting, and (4) estimates derived from Method 2 weighting. Estimates (1) and (2) were computed primarily to gain insight around the degree to which approaches (3) and (4) affect the bias of the unweighted and unadjusted eight-state estimates. Finally, the NSCAW I full sample estimates were computed, which provided the “gold-standard” estimates used to evaluate the quality of estimates (1) through (4) for national inference. Because the NSCAW IV design will use three domains—the eight NSCAW I domains were collapsed to create the three NSCAW IV domains and the quality analysis was repeated for these “ad hoc” domains. The NSCAW I QRW analyses demonstrated the success of these methods for extend inference from the NSCAW IV purposively selected state sample to the national level. Although some bias could remain in the estimates after weighting, the biases were significantly reduced from their unweighted counterparts for the vast majority of estimates. For substantive characteristics such as the CBCL variables, the biases in the QRW estimates were slightly larger but still acceptable for many research purposes. The results for the NSCAW I analysis were essentially confirmed using NSCAW II data: both data sets produced very similar results. SPM offers an alternative to QRW for creating national estimates from the L-state design. Because it incorporates specific covariates that are the most highly correlated with the outcome variable, it can achieve much greater estimation accuracy than is possible with the more general QRW methodology. A key distinction between SPM and the QRW is that, although the latter can be applied to any outcome variable, SPM must be tailored to each specific outcome variable of interest; i.e., each questionnaire variable represents a dependent variable in its own customized model. Nevertheless, for questionnaire variables where the QRW estimates have, or are suspected to have, unacceptably large biases, SPM offers a less biased alternative and can be used to produce higher quality inferences. The SPM analyses used the eight-state strata to project national estimates and then evaluated those estimates by comparing them to the corresponding national sample estimates that served as the gold standard. The results showed that, at least for the variables considered from NSCAW I and II, SPM produces excellent results, with very small biases in most instances. Based on these results, we believe the SPM approach is quite feasible for the NSCAW IV L-state design. Thus, its use is recommended for NSCAW IV, particularly in situations where QRW estimates are shown or suspected to be unacceptably biased.",2024-10-22T04:57:14.892238+00:00,"use of administrative data for survey inference,super-population modeling,child welfare,nonprobability sample inference,coverage bias,quasi-randomization weighting,child abuse",,,"Paul P.

Therefore, this research aimed to investigate postgraduate students’ attitudes toward using ChatGPT to enhance the quality of their Master’s thesis and identify the aspects of thesis writing where ChatGPT is most beneficial from postgraduates’ perspectives. A mixed-method design was implemented using semi-structured interviews and a questionnaire; it includes a sample of 31 postgraduate students, 21 (68 %) females and 10 (32%) males. The findings revealed that postgraduate EFL learners demonstrate a highly positive attitude toward using ChatGPT as an AI assistant tool to improve the quality of their Master’s thesis. Moreover, the findings of the analysis of the interviews revealed that students found ChatGPT to be a source of information, an idea generation and analyzing tool, proofreading support, grammar correction, sentence structure improvement, thesis structure and APA style citation, and a source of instant feedback improving students’ thesis writing. This study is significant because these students turned to ChatGPT as an alternative solution to bridge the gap and improve the overall quality of their thesis writing.

E021B-BA7-D68,Disentangling pandemic from George Floyd’s murder as the cause of the 2020 increase in violence,"Background:
There is considerable debate about whether the unprecedented rise in violence experienced across the United States in 2020 was caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or George Floyd’s murder by Minneapolis police. This study aimed to add clarity by analysing violent crime data in Minneapolis.
Methods:
Interrupted time series on daily occurrences/counts of homicide, aggravated assault, domestic assault, sex offenses, detected gunfire, and 911 calls from 2019-2021 in Minneapolis. Models included logistic and quasi-Poisson regressions, adjusting for weekend, holidays, and maximum daily temperature. 
Results: 
Reported violent events did not increase during the pandemic, while incidence of sex offenses decreased 18% (95%CI: 0.71-0.93) and 911 calls by 3% (95%CI: 0.96-0.98). After Floyd’s murder, homicide increased 137% (95%CI: 1.10-5.11), aggravated assaults by 43% (95%CI: 1.23-1.66), sex offenses by 35% (95%CI: 1.05-1.74), and gunfire by 108% (95%CI: 1.81-2.40), while 911 calls decreased 5% (95%CI: 0.92-0.97).
Conclusions: 
Floyd’s murder better explains the 2020 rise in violence. The immediate rise in gunfire after Floyd’s murder suggests a change in the willingness to use firearms already in possession rather than a sudden influx of them, while the drop in 911 calls aligns with the theory that the causative mechanism was community members disengaging from police to address crime and resolved disputes.",2025-06-20,COVID-19; homicide; violence; police abuses,,,Tyler J Lane,socarxiv

E00B0-418-4C9,Intergenerational Continuity of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs)  Among Cebuano Mothers: A Moderated Mediation Model,"Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are traumatic events children experience before reaching 18 years old and are known to be passed on from generation to generation, which suggests that experiencing ACEs at an early age often leads to subsequent abuse and maltreatment perpetration in adulthood. However, identifying factors that facilitate ACE transmission has always been a challenge, given the issue's complexity. This study aimed to address this gap and identified two contextual factors (parental proximal stressors and negative parenting practices) and investigated their mediating and moderating effects on the continuity of ACEs from mothers (G2) to their children (G3). Data collected from 230 mothers in Cebu City, Philippines, were analyzed using second-stage moderated mediation (model 15) to determine the conditional indirect effect of G2 ACEs towards G3 ACEs via parental proximal stressors as a function of negative parenting practices. Overall results established a moderated mediation model (F(5,224) = 18.26, p&lt;.001, R²=.3075), suggesting that the interaction of parental proximal stressors and negative parenting practices increases the risk of continuity of ACEs from one generation to the next. Recommendations include preventive education of ACEs and adopting early intervention efforts to stop the cycle of abuse and neglect, preventing subsequent perpetration in adulthood.",2025-06-17,"Adverse Childhood Experiences,Intergenerational Continuity of Abuse and Neglect,Negative Parenting Practices",,,Reymart R.

Toxicity and Gender in Digital Political Spaces: Evidence from the 2024 European Elections,"This study investigates gender differences in online toxicity towards a sample of candidates in the 2024 European Parliament elections. Using data from five EU countries and drawing on a dataset of over 3.2 million posts mentioning 88 candidates, we applied a mixed-methods approach to assess the volume and nature of online abuse. Toxicity levels were measured using a state-of-the-art toxicity detection algorithm. After developing a comprehensive coding scheme, qualitative content analysis was performed on a subset of posts with the highest probability of being perceived as toxic to examine gendered patterns of abuse.
While a purely quantitative analysis did not reveal significant differences between the number of toxic replies received by female and male candidates that the gender alone could explain, qualitative insights uncovered systematic semiotic violence against women in politics. Female politicians were more often targeted with personal and degrading attacks, including sexist slurs, sexually explicit content, and attempts to silence or delegitimise them. In contrast, male candidates were likelier to receive insults tied to their political conduct and professional criticism. Moreover, replies to women are significantly more likely to include multiple elements of toxicity, indicating a higher intensity of online harassment.
These results underscore the need for platform and user accountability, nuanced moderation policies, and legal protections that reflect the gendered dimensions of online political violence. Our research highlights the persistence of digital misogyny as a barrier to gender parity in democratic participation and stresses the urgency of cross-sectoral strategies to combat this issue during electoral processes.",2025-07-24,"European elections,content analysis,online harassment,online toxicity,technology-facilitated gender-based violence",,,"Paula Fortuna, Emilia Gomez, João Vinagre, Cristian Consonni, Lorenzo Porcaro, Gerrit Bostelmann, Eleonora Esposito, Arianna Sala",socarxiv

through ambiguity, making it difficult to identify, challenge, or remediate. Drawing upon 
the interplay between avoidant and obsessive-compulsive personality traits and 
grounding its theoretical analysis in the dysfunction of meta-communication, this 
study proposes a novel explanatory framework for understanding silence as a 
deliberate and damaging organizational act. The paper situates this concept within the 
broader theory of structural selection pressure (Hiraoka, 2025a), arguing that silent 
harassment constitutes a micro-level manifestation of cultural degeneration within 
hierarchical institutions. Through a hypothetical case-based analysis, the model 
demonstrates how psychological dispositions and organizational dynamics interact to 
create environments where exclusion is normalized and competence is silently

Victim-abusers dyads were successfully randomised at court in 85% of cases and the deterrence message was delivered to the intervention group in 83% of cases, half of which were in court and half of which were via telephone or post. All eligible victims were offered the alarm by a police domestic abuse liaison officer, but fewer than 10% accepted the alarm. No statistically significant difference was observed in rates of order breach or domestic abuse crimes across conditions.

Using Growing Up in Scotland, a nationally representative longitudinal child cohort study of children born in 2004-05, we investigate social inequalities in social work contact for children living with parental domestic violence and abuse (working sample n:3216). Using logit models, we examine associations between self-reported maternal experiences of domestic violence and abuse (when children were aged 0-6 years old), and social work service contact for study-children (across ages 2-7 years old), controlling for socio-demographic factors, illicit substance use, alcohol consumption, parental separation, and maternal mental health. Maternal reports of domestic violence and abuse significantly increased the likelihood of social worker contact for the study-child. Social worker involvement was far more likely in low-income households. Where domestic violence and abuse had been reported, social worker contact was twice as likely for boys than for girls. Findings suggest significant socio-economic disparities and gender discrepancies in the social work service response in the context of domestic violence and abuse.

Drawing on 41 Australian and international peer-reviewed and grey literature sources, the review identifies pathways of housing loss through economic coercion, safety threats, and actions from abusers that can prevent women from acquiring stable housing. Homeless DV survivors experience heightened trauma, poor mental health, and barriers to help-seeking. The evidence highlights the effectiveness of empowerment-based casework, safe-at-home programs, rental subsidies, and flexible funding in fostering resiliency. Based on these findings, policy recommendations focus on DV education before separation, as well as housing projects that are integrated with survivor-centred support services to prevent homelessness and promote recovery.

Drawing on psychological literature, including foundational work by Freyd, Herman, van der Kolk, and others, the paper maps the subjective experience of betrayal trauma-particularly in narcissistic abuse-as a nonlinear process of healing, akin to walking a labyrinth. The methodology employed is a synthesis of empirical studies, theoretical frameworks, and lived experience. The analysis highlights the collapse of perceptual trust, the reorganization of autobiographical memory, and introduces the novel concept of the ""grey phase""-a distinct period marked by emotional numbness, psychic detachment, and dissociation. While this phase has been described implicitly in trauma literature, this paper explicitly names and frames it as a neurobiological and psychological intermission essential to recovery. This layered, compassionate, and academically grounded model enhances understanding of how trauma ruptures narrative identity and how healing entails its gradual reconstruction.
