59qjw_v1,The Imitation Game: Examining Regulatory Challenges of  Political Deepfakes in the European Union,"The global impact of deepfake technology is becoming increasingly evident everywhere around the world, including in the European Union. The worrisome consequences of deepfake technology extend not only to the film and entertainment industry but also within the political sphere. Such development could contribute to the further erosion of truth and trust, which weaken core democratic functions and norms. Against this backdrop, this dissertation aims to answer the following research question: how should political deepfakes be regulated in the EU? In conclusion, this dissertation reveals four distinct conclusions regarding the implications of political deepfakes on democracy and fundamental rights, as well as the inadequacies of existing regulations in addressing the associated challenges within the EU.",2024-04-06T12:52:25.971221,"AI Act,DSA,EU,GDPR,Political Deepfake",,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/59qjw_v1/,Alia Yofira Karunian,socarxiv
6wuhj_v1,Sexualization of Children in Deepfakes and Hentai:  Examining Reddit User Views,"Based on a large dataset (N=13293) of Reddit comments collected on the topic, this article takes a qualitative approach to examine Reddit users’ views and attitudes about the sexualization of minors (SOM) in deepfakes and hentai. The analysis captured five major themes in the discussion over SOM: illegality, art, promoting pedophilia, increase in offending and general harmfulness. Furthermore, the discussion was underscored by the central question of who is a minor, which feeds the already problematic definitional ambiguity and keeps the perceived discursive boundaries of the illegality of SOM in flux. Current study adds to the existing literature by presenting information that could be useful in designing prevention and awareness efforts addressing SOM and CSAM, particularly to the general public.",2021-03-25T10:02:22.724253,"child sexual abuse,child sexual abuse material,child sexual exploitation,CSA,deep-fake,deepfake,hentai,qualitative,reddit,sexualization,sexualization of minors",10.3176/tr.2022.2.07,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6wuhj_v1/,Simone Eelmaa,socarxiv
7gve2_v1,Individual Attitudes Toward Deepfakes of Deceased Artists,"This exploratory qualitative study uses a multilevel framework, combining the Social Construction of Technology and the Cognitive-Affective-Normative model, to examine how individual perceptions, emotions, and reflections shape deepfake acceptance, particularly those featuring deceased artists. Fifty-one participants (70.37% female; Mean Age = 24.6) took part in six online focus groups, viewing two randomly selected deepfakes of deceased artists. Thematic analysis, using a phenomenological approach, identified primarily intellectual reactions, with two key layers: first-order evaluations of realism and second-order societal impact assessments. These impacts spanned micro (individuals), meso (content creators/distributors), and macro (society-wide) levels. While cognitive and ethical concerns were prominent, emotional responses were fewer, often expressing discomfort or surprise. Findings offer valuable insights for the digital media industry and regulators in understanding public reception of deepfake technology.",2024-11-11T21:40:11.493048,"Artist revival,Attitudes,Attitudes toward technology,Deceased artists,Deepfakes,Digital resurrection,Fake content,Social construction of technology,Technology acceptance",,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7gve2_v1/,"María T.

b8n5f_v1,"Africa DeepFakes Buzz: Exploring online media socio-political discourses on deepfakes- Focus on Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa.","Deepfakes media is produced using artificial intelligence neural networks known as Generative Adversarial Networks. This AI technique has been used to combine, replace or superimpose images and videos to create controversial deepfakes videos. The emergence of deepfakes has been referred to as infopocalypse due to the difficulty the content poses to producers, publishers, and consumers of information. Recent studies in Europe, China, and the United States have reported a rise in user cynicism, apprehension, and erosion of journalists' roles. However, literature is lacking on African online media discourses on deepfakes technology and content. Using mediatization theory and reflexive inductive thematic analysis, this study sought to fill this gap by investigating socio-political discourses, perceptions, and awareness of deepfakes technology and media content in Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa. Findings indicate that, unlike the rest of the world, online media is concerned about deepfakes impact on already fragile political and security situations, particularly during the electioneering period. There are deep anxieties about the rising cases of deepfakes-instigated financial fraud, religious animosity, xenophobic attacks, and cyber-harassment. Also, even though there is a genuine effort to enumerate deepfakes usefulness through media/legal/public literacy and awareness, the general online media logic and perception are dystopian. Implications are discussed.",2023-01-11T14:53:16.649212,"Africa,Artificial intelligence,Deepfakes,Kenya,Media,Nigeria,South Africa,Synthetic media",,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b8n5f_v1/,John Maina Karanja,socarxiv
cxjaq_v1,The Role of Critical Thinking in Combating Deepfakes in Politics and Misinformation,"It is proposed of this paper to show that Critical thinking empowers individuals to rigorously
analyze information and identify inconsistencies or anomalies, an indispensable skill for detecting
deepfakes, which often exhibit subtle visual or auditory manipulation cues. For instance, critical thinkers
can more effectively discern unnatural facial movements, inconsistencies in lighting or shadows, and other
common artifacts in deepfakes. Cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias, increase susceptibility to
misinformation that conforms to pre-existing beliefs. Critical thinking education raises awareness of these
biases and cultivates strategies to mitigate their impact by promoting skepticism and inquiry, critical
thinking reduces the likelihood of accepting false information at face value and encourages the pursuit of
credible sources and evidence.",2024-06-27T06:54:21.665337,"critical thinking,disinformation,misinformation,political deepfakes,uncertainty",,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cxjaq_v1/,Natali Lourenço Nascimento,socarxiv
f4zbx_v1,Individual Variables Predicting Responses to Deepfakes: A Cross-Cultural Contrast.,"This study examines the impact of the Big Five personality traits, need for cognition (NFC), and need for affect (NFA) on responses to deepfakes across different genres (entertainment, political, and cheapfakes). Data from 1554 participants in Spain (n = 782) and the United States (n = 772) were analyzed regarding narrative transportation, realism, identification, enjoyment, and parasocial interaction. The findings suggest that extraversion, conscientiousness, and agreeableness positively influence emotional and cognitive engagement with deepfakes, whereas neuroticism reduces enjoyment and connection. NFC enhances engagement with complex content, particularly in political deepfakes, whereas NFA strengthens emotional engagement, especially in entertainment deepfakes. U.S. participants exhibit higher cognitive and emotional responses than their Spanish counterparts, suggesting that cultural context moderates the impact of individual variables. These findings highlight the interplay between personality traits, NFC, and NFA in shaping deepfake reception, and emphasize the need to consider cultural factors in future research.",2025-05-22T21:06:46.528767,"Deepfakes, personality traits, need for cognition, need for affect, enjoyment, identification with characters, narrative transportation, parasocial interaction, perceived realism, cross-cultural.",,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f4zbx_v1/,"María T.

mhd48_v2,Motivations for (Not) Sharing Deepfakes on Social Media,"This research applies Uses and Gratifications theory to examine individual motivations for sharing or not sharing deepfakes. After characterizing popular deepfakes in five genres (two examples each), 1035 US participants (42% female; Age: M = 42.8, SD = 14.1, Mdn = 41, Range = 18–93) watched one of the ten deepfakes and completed a questionnaire in Prolific. Results show that most participants would not share the deepfakes due to a lack of personal relevance. However, those who did intend to share them had hedonistic motivations, mostly enjoyment and the desire to share entertainment with others. The genre of these deepfakes also influenced motivations to share, with political deepfakes being a particularly specific case, and one where gender also had a greater impact. Women avoid sharing inaccurate information to a greater extent and men are more inclined to protect their image in social circles. Overall, this research highlights how audiences dynamically relate to deepfakes and offers insights into the psychological aspects of their relationships with this emerging media form. It also underscores the significance of the perceived entertainment value of deepfakes in their virality.",2025-05-07T12:29:03.921987,"Artificial Intelligence,Deepfakes,Fake content,Media refusal,Motivations,Sharing intentions,Uses and gratifications,Virality",,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mhd48_v2/,"María T.

mznge_v1,Moral intuitions behind deepfake-related discussions in Reddit communities,"Deepfakes are AI-synthesized content that are becoming popular on many social media platforms, meaning the use of deepfakes is increasing in society, regardless of its societal implications. Its implications are harmful if the moral intuitions behind deepfakes are problematic; thus, it is important to explore how the moral intuitions behind deepfakes unfold in communities at scale. However, understanding perceived moral viewpoints unfolding in digital contexts is challenging, due to the complexities in conversations. In this research, we demonstrate how Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) can be used as a lens through which to operationalize moral viewpoints in discussions about deepfakes on Reddit communities. Using the extended Moral Foundations Dictionary (eMFD), we measured the strengths of moral intuition (moral loading) behind 101,869 Reddit posts. We present the discussions that unfolded on Reddit in 2018–2022 wherein intuitions behind some posts were found to be morally questionable to society. Our results may help platforms detect and take action against immoral activities related to deepfakes.",2023-03-04T14:14:24.589268,"Communities,Deepfake discussions,deepfakes,Discourse Analysis,Moral Foundation Theory,Moral intuitions,Reddit",,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mznge_v1/,"Dilrukshi Gamage, Hariharan Raveenthiran, Kazutoshi Sasahara",socarxiv
q6mwn_v1,The Liar’s Dividend: Can Politicians Use Deepfakes and Fake News to Evade Accountability?,"This study addresses the phenomenon of misinformation about misinformation, or politicians ""crying wolf"" over fake news. Strategic and false allegations that stories are fake news or deepfakes may benefit politicians by helping them maintain support in the face of information damaging to their reputation. We posit that this concept, known as the ""liar's dividend,"" works through two theoretical channels: by invoking informational uncertainty or by encouraging oppositional rallying of core supporters. To evaluate the implications of the liar's dividend, we use three survey experiments detailing hypothetical politician responses to video or text news stories depicting real politician scandals. We find that allegations of misinformation raise politician support, while potentially undermining trust in media. Moreover, these false claims produce greater dividends for politicians than longstanding alternative responses to scandal, such as remaining silent or apologizing. Finally, false allegations of misinformation pay off less for videos (""deepfakes"") than text stories (""fake news"").",2022-05-11T02:35:03.803402,"deepfake,fake news,media,misinformation,survey experiment,trust",,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q6mwn_v1/,"Kaylyn Jackson Schiff, Daniel S.
