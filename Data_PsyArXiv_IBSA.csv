b4fgc_v1,Understanding Image-Based Sexual Abuse through Greek Public and Legal Lenses: A Constructionist Thematic Analysis,"Image-Based Sexual Abuse (IBSA), including deepfake sexual abuse - where fake yet lifelike sexual content is generated of non-consenting persons - constitutes a growing form of digitally mediated gender-based violence that remains largely under-researched within non-Anglophonic contexts. This study explores how IBSA is constructed and perceived by both laypeople and lawyers in Greece, a Southern European setting characterised by economic precarity, traditional gender norms, and evolving yet challenging legal frameworks. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with 21 participants either originating from or living in Greece (n = 16 lay persons, n = 5 legal professionals), we employed constructionist thematic analysis to examine how participants discursively frame IBSA, its motivations, barriers to reporting, legal challenges, and preventative measures. Five themes were identified: (1) constructions of IBSA as gendered violence motivated by control, humiliation, and financial exploitation; (2) barriers to reporting shaped by shame, stigma, and widespread mistrust in police institutions; (3) legal barriers related to financial inaccessibility and fragmented, outdated legal frameworks; (4) the central role of informal support networks alongside calls for education and public awareness; and (5) deepfake technologies as an emergent form of economic exploitation, particularly impacting sex workers within a legal vacuum. The findings highlight the need for structurally informed, context-sensitive responses to IBSA that address the intersections of gender, law, technology, and economic vulnerability.",2025-07-03T10:04:19.946226,,,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/b4fgc_v1/,"Anastasia Rousaki, Dean Fido"
6qr7t_v1,Development and validation of the Beliefs about Revenge Pornography Questionnaire,"Revenge pornography has become an increasingly prominent topic in social and legislative discussions about sexual crime, but has received relatively little attention within psychological research. Here, we leveraged existing theorizing in the area of sexual offending proclivity to systematically develop and validate of a measure of beliefs about revenge pornography. Using a large international community sample (N = 511) we found our ‘Beliefs about Revenge Pornography Questionnaire (BRPQ)’ to be comprised of three underpinning domains: ‘Victims as Responsible’, ‘Sociological Explanations’, and ‘Revenge Pornography as a Sexual Offense’. Concurrent validity is demonstrated through relationships with trait empathy, belief in a just world, dark personality traits, and rape myth acceptance. Randomly dividing the sample, we also show that the BRPQ predicts both revenge pornography proclivity (n = 227) and social judgements of this type of offending (n = 233). Implications and future directions are discussed.",2020-11-28T22:38:34.394099,"forensic psychology,images based sexual abuse,offense proclivity,revenge pornography,scale development,scale validation,sexual abuse,social attitudes",,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/6qr7t_v1/,"Craig A.

pwmqu_v1,Intrasexual competition as a predictor of women’s judgements of revenge pornography offending,"Recent legislative developments have led to a marked increase in the empirical investigation of motivations and judgements of so-called acts of ‘revenge pornography’ offending. In two independently-sampled studies, we used moderation analyses to investigate whether higher levels of intrasexual competition predicted more lenient judgements of revenge pornography offences as a function of sex (Study 1, N = 241), and whether such relationships would be further moderated by physical attractiveness (Study 2, N = 402). Potential covariates of callous-unemotional traits, empathy, and victimization history were controlled for. Opposing our hypotheses, we consistently observed a trend for higher levels of intrasexual competition being associated with more lenient judgements of revenge pornography offences involving male victims by female participants. The results are discussed in terms of intrasexual competition potentially sharing variance with unobserved constructs in the wider sexological literature, and of the key relevance of these findings for future empirical investigation into judgements of non-consensual image-based offending.

5bmav_v2,Understanding how survivors of non-consensual intimate image dissemination are perceived by UK and Norwegian respondents,"Purpose: In popular media, ‘revenge pornography’ refers to the non-consensual sharing of intimate images (NCSII) of another. Despite survivors of NCSII facing long-term consequences, they still face victim-blaming attitudes. Extant literature has typically sampled from countries where NCSII has long been illegal, such as the United Kingdom (UK); neglecting perspectives from countries lacking NCSII-specific legislation, such as Norway at the time of data collection. 
Methods: Participants (n = 477) from the UK and Norway responded to vignettes depicting NCSII, which differed by the survivor-perpetrator relationship depicted (i.e., casual vs. committed). 
Results: Controlling for participant sex and psychopathic personality traits (previously implicated in judgements of image-based sexual abuse), UK citizens perceived NCSII to have worse impacts on survivors than Norwegian citizens. Moreover, data trends suggested participants attributed increased victim-blame in vignettes featuring casual relationships, with higher self-reported psychopathic personality traits predicting judgements associated with viewing NCSII as less criminal in nature. 
Conclusion: These findings emphasise a need to better understand the role of legislation in public perceptions of NCSII (and image-based sexual abuse more broadly) and the need to be conscious about further exploring technology-facilitated crime internationally.",2025-03-27T10:15:31.682898,"image-based sexual abuse,non-consensual sharing of intimate images,psychopathy,revenge pornography,victim blame",,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/5bmav_v2/,"Dean Fido, Anny C.

vpydn_v1,Delineating non-consensual sexual image offending: Towards an empirical approach,"The topic of non-consensual sexual images has become an increasingly important issue within the social policy landscape. Social and legal scholars have advocated for these behaviours to be designated sexual offences due to the mode of perpetration of these behaviours, but are explicit in their rejection of a sexual element being important in the motivations underpinning such behaviours. However, this rejection is inconsistent with the core theoretical models related to sexual offending. In this article, we outline some of the potential psychological concepts that may help us to understand how and why people engage in a range of non-consensual sexual image offences, such as revenge pornography, upskirting, deepfake media production, and cyber-flashing. In doing so, we aim to begin to bridge the gap between legal scholars and psychological scientists, and develop a more comprehensive and theoretically coherent approach to studying this important social topic.",2019-06-12T19:58:21.005041,"courtship disorder,cyber-flashing,deepfake,dick pics,exhibitionism,non-consensual sexual images,pornography,revenge pornography,sexual offending,upskirting",,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/vpydn_v1/,"Craig A.

pqwec_v1,Examining the Gendered Impacts of Technology-Facilitated Sexual Violence: A Mixed Methods Approach,"This study employed a mixed methods approach, integrating quantitative online survey data (N = 333; Mage = 33.91; 63% women) with qualitative interview data (N = 10; Agerange = 24-46; 50% women) to gain a more comprehensive understanding of TFSV. We found that victims of TFSV experienced anxiety, stress, depression, loss of control, mistrust, multiple victimizations, poor academic/occupation functioning, problematic alcohol consumption, embarrassment, and online behaviour changes (e.g., limiting personal information online) due to TFSV victimization. Individuals who experienced online image-based abuse reported greater distress on items of depression, anxiety, and occupational/academic functioning than did victims of other types of TFSV. The current study provides partial support for the gender similarities hypothesis that TFSV is not exclusively a gender-based harm; our findings suggest that women and men’s TFSV experiences are similar for most TFSV types. Overall, the present study demonstrates the negative impact TFSV has for both women and men and highlights the need for greater awareness and increased support for all victims of this form of sexual violence.",2021-11-08T18:12:34.754104,"gender,internet abuse,mixed methods,sexual harassment,sexual violence,technology",,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/pqwec_v1/,"Amanda champion, Flora Blanchette, Devinder Khera, Cory Pedersen"
7bm45_v1,Examining Perceptions of Sextortion in the General Population,"The non-consensual sharing of sexual images of another (or threats thereof) represents an increasingly important and pervasive issue in forensic psychology. However, despite recent legislative developments within the United Kingdom, there still exists a need for greater understanding of perceptions within the general public of the dangers and manifestations of image-based sexual abuse and the process by which people are being (s)extorted using their private images. Ten participants (Mage = 24.8 years; SD = 9.33; 70% female) took part in semi-structured interviews which were analysed using an inductive thematic analytic approach, wherein the themes of [1] Education as a Prevention against Image Based Sexual Abuse, [2] Victim Blaming Prevalence in Society, [3] Stereotypes about Victim and Perpetrator, and [4] Low Priority for Criminal Justice were explored. Taken together, data suggests that although there exists a ‘working knowledge’ of image-based sexual abuse, the concept of sextortion is understood to a lesser extent with clear implications for the need for educational policies to better inform younger members of society of associated dangers and legalities.",2021-10-11T12:46:44.301696,"Image-Based Sexual Abuse,Revenge Pornography,Sextortion,Thematic Analysis",,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/7bm45_v1/,"Anisha Gohil, Dean Fido"
