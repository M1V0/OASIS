E023A-304-483,Examining Perceptions of Sextortion in the General Population,"The non-consensual sharing of sexual images of another (or threats thereof) represents an increasingly important and pervasive issue in forensic psychology. However, despite recent legislative developments within the United Kingdom, there still exists a need for greater understanding of perceptions within the general public of the dangers and manifestations of image-based sexual abuse and the process by which people are being (s)extorted using their private images. Ten participants (Mage = 24.8 years; SD = 9.33; 70% female) took part in semi-structured interviews which were analysed using an inductive thematic analytic approach, wherein the themes of [1] Education as a Prevention against Image Based Sexual Abuse, [2] Victim Blaming Prevalence in Society, [3] Stereotypes about Victim and Perpetrator, and [4] Low Priority for Criminal Justice were explored. Taken together, data suggests that although there exists a ‘working knowledge’ of image-based sexual abuse, the concept of sextortion is understood to a lesser extent with clear implications for the need for educational policies to better inform younger members of society of associated dangers and legalities.",2021-10-11T12:46:44.301696+00:00,"thematic analysis,image-based sexual abuse,sextortion,revenge pornography",,,"Dean Fido, Anisha Gohil",psyarxiv
E0165-17D-8A8,Intrasexual competition as a predictor of women’s judgements of revenge pornography offending,"Recent legislative developments have led to a marked increase in the empirical investigation of motivations and judgements of so-called acts of ‘revenge pornography’ offending. In two independently-sampled studies, we used moderation analyses to investigate whether higher levels of intrasexual competition predicted more lenient judgements of revenge pornography offences as a function of sex (Study 1, N = 241), and whether such relationships would be further moderated by physical attractiveness (Study 2, N = 402). Potential covariates of callous-unemotional traits, empathy, and victimization history were controlled for. Opposing our hypotheses, we consistently observed a trend for higher levels of intrasexual competition being associated with more lenient judgements of revenge pornography offences involving male victims by female participants. The results are discussed in terms of intrasexual competition potentially sharing variance with unobserved constructs in the wider sexological literature, and of the key relevance of these findings for future empirical investigation into judgements of non-consensual image-based offending.

E00D0-0EA-C6A,The Scientometrics of Child Sexual Exploitation Material Offending:  An Analysis of Fifty Years of Academic Research,"Child sexual exploitation material (CSEM) research is an increasingly important area of interdisciplinary study.  Key research areas include offenders and offending behavior; legal and societal issues; victimology; treatment; investigations; digital forensics; and deterrence.   Many publications are multidisciplinary, with fields including law, psychology, criminal justice, sociology, digital forensics, data analytics, and related areas.  This study examines the historical body of research on CSEM offending through a scientometric review.  The Web of Science Core Collection was searched for relevant research articles with no date restrictions, and 990 responsive papers published between 1979 and the present were identified.  The key authors in the field included Michael Seto (n=31, fc=10.87), Ethel Quayle (n=21, fc=7.49), and Kathryn Seigfried-Spellar (n=12, fc=7.17), with the paper “Prevalence and Characteristics of Youth Sexing: A National Study” by Mitchell et al. identified as the most cited.  Historiographical analysis identified works by Ethel Quayle and Max Taylor as well as Michael Seto as seminal papers in the field, and the United States (45.7%, n=452), the United Kingdom (29.2%, n=289), and Australia (23.6%, n=234) as the countries with the highest numbers of publications.  Keyword analyses found the terms child pornography and indecent images decreasing over time, and the terms CSEM and child sexual abuse images increasing in usage.",2025-05-31,Scientometrics; Child Sexual Exploitation Material; Child Sexual Abuse Material,,,Chad M.S.

E00BD-0A7-E14,Judgements of Deepfake Sexual Abuse Victims Differ as a Function of Facial Versus Body Likenesses,"We are witnessing exponential growth in the use of machine learning to create fake – yet indistinguishable - sexual media of others without their consent. Though there is an emerging understanding of the impact that deepfake sexual abuse (DSA) has on its victims and societal understanding thereof, this knowledge pertains entirely to individuals whose facial likeness has been used within said material, with little-to-no attention paid to those whose bodies are used as the canvas; individuals who are predominantly sex workers. Across 321 participants (Mage = 45.70 years, SD = 15.88; 48.9% female), vignettes were used to explore differences in societal judgements of DSA for victims whose face (versus body) was used to generate DSA material, and whether they were labelled as a sex worker. Though perceived criminality did not differ across conditions, participants allocated more blame and less anticipated harm to DSA victims whose body, relative to whose face, was used. This effect was enhanced in vignettes labelling them as sex workers. When exploring correlations using demographics, beliefs, and personality traits, being older, male, and viewing sex work as ‘a choice’ and/or ‘deviant’ predicted greater victim blame, lower perceived criminality, and less anticipated harm. High self-reported empathy was the only predictor of greater anticipated harm. Results indicate the importance of understanding broader impacts of DSA - regardless of the victim - for stakeholders within the criminal justice system, and a continued need to generate public awareness of DSA through international policy.",2025-03-12,"OnlyFans,deepfake sexual abuse,image-based sexual abuse,sex workers,technology-facilitated sexual violence",,,"Dominic Ruddy, Dean Fido, Harriet Goldfinch, Craig Harper",psyarxiv
E01F5-022-85A,"Celebrity status, sex, and variation in psychopathy predicts judgements of and proclivity to generate and distribute deepfake pornography","With the advent of means to generate and disseminate fake, sexualised images of others for the purposes of financial gain, harassment, or sexual gratification, there is a need to assess and understand the public’s awareness and judgements of said behaviour. In two independently-sampled studies, we used moderation (Study 1) and linear mixed effects (Study 2) analyses to investigate whether judgements of deepfaking differed as a function of victim status (celebrity, non-celebrity), victim and participant demographics, and image use (sharing, own sexual gratification), whilst controlling for the potential covariates of psychopathy and beliefs about a just world. We consistently observed more lenient judgements of deepfake generation and dissemination for victims who were celebrities and male, and when images were created for self-sexual gratification rather than being shared. Moreover, lenient judgements, as well as proclivity to act were predicted by greater levels of psychopathy. We discuss our findings in the context of needing to qualitatively understand the general public’s rationale for said disparity in judgements, as well as identifying and combating barriers to disclose victimisation.

E007E-C63-ED8,Understanding how survivors of non-consensual intimate image dissemination are perceived by UK and Norwegian respondents,"Purpose: In popular media, ‘revenge pornography’ refers to the non-consensual sharing of intimate images (NCSII) of another. Despite survivors of NCSII facing long-term consequences, they still face victim-blaming attitudes. Extant literature has typically sampled from countries where NCSII has long been illegal, such as the United Kingdom (UK); neglecting perspectives from countries lacking NCSII-specific legislation, such as Norway at the time of data collection. 
Methods: Participants (n = 477) from the UK and Norway responded to vignettes depicting NCSII, which differed by the survivor-perpetrator relationship depicted (i.e., casual vs. committed). 
Results: Controlling for participant sex and psychopathic personality traits (previously implicated in judgements of image-based sexual abuse), UK citizens perceived NCSII to have worse impacts on survivors than Norwegian citizens. Moreover, data trends suggested participants attributed increased victim-blame in vignettes featuring casual relationships, with higher self-reported psychopathic personality traits predicting judgements associated with viewing NCSII as less criminal in nature. 
Conclusion: These findings emphasise a need to better understand the role of legislation in public perceptions of NCSII (and image-based sexual abuse more broadly) and the need to be conscious about further exploring technology-facilitated crime internationally.",2025-03-27,"image-based sexual abuse,non-consensual sharing of intimate images,psychopathy,revenge pornography,victim blame",,,"Anny C.

E008F-58D-4B7,Content Moderator Startle Response: A Qualitative Study,"Commercial Content Moderators review user-generated content (UGC) to ensure the posts meet platform policies, guidelines, community standards, and regional laws. While the majority of posted UGC is deemed acceptable, a large amount of content remains, which is classified as non-compliant and may include gore, violence, suicide, child sexual abuse material (CSAM), and pornography, to name a few. Because of this, content moderators have a greater prevalence of their nervous system activating a startle response, which can impact emotional, psychological, and physiological processes. Prior research on content moderators has failed to explore moderators' initial reactions to content from the start of employment through tenure as the subjection to material and habituation increases. This study takes an in-depth look at moderators' experiences from recruiting, through training, and production to better understand the content moderators' startle response and factors that enable startle habituation. The current study sample consisted of a total of 78 respondents - 38 content moderators located in the Philippines employed by TaskUs Inc. and 40 content moderators located in Estonia employed by Sutherland Global Services. Employee tenure ranged from 0-6 months. Succeeding our analysis, transparency, understanding, and preparedness were major themes identified as the critical factors found within both companies when exploring the activation of the startle response and facilitation of habituation following content exposure. These themes were prevalent in the recruiting, training, and production phases of the employment life-cycle.",2022-06-01T18:40:11.349917+00:00,"recruitment,startle habituation,startle response,wellbeing,resilience,commercial content moderation,training",,,"Rainer Mere, Priyanka Manchanda, Miriah E.

E006A-6B7-D83,"Understanding social judgments of, and proclivities to commit upskirting","Against a backdrop of legislative change that sees the taking of private sexual images underneath the clothing of a non-consenting other being made a criminal offence – upskirting – there is a need to understand the public’s judgments of, and motivations to perpetrate said behavior. In this study (N = 490), we investigated whether judgments of upskirting differed as a function of victim sex (male, female) and their perceived attractiveness (attractive, unattractive), as well as how variation in voyeuristic interest, belief in a just world, and psychopathic personality traits predicted judgments of, and proclivity to engage in upskirting behaviors. We consistently observed more lenient judgments of upskirting behaviors when victims were attractive and male, with such judgements predicted by older age across all conditions. Moreover, proclivity to engage in upskirting was predicted by past voyeuristic behaviors, higher psychopathic personality, and being male and of older age. We discuss our findings in the context of needing to qualitatively understand the general public’s rationale for said disparity in judgments, as well as identifying and combating barriers to disclose victimization.

E001A-280-175,Examining the Gendered Impacts of Technology-Facilitated Sexual Violence: A Mixed Methods Approach,"This study employed a mixed methods approach, integrating quantitative online survey data (N = 333; Mage = 33.91; 63% women) with qualitative interview data (N = 10; Agerange = 24-46; 50% women) to gain a more comprehensive understanding of TFSV. We found that victims of TFSV experienced anxiety, stress, depression, loss of control, mistrust, multiple victimizations, poor academic/occupation functioning, problematic alcohol consumption, embarrassment, and online behaviour changes (e.g., limiting personal information online) due to TFSV victimization. Individuals who experienced online image-based abuse reported greater distress on items of depression, anxiety, and occupational/academic functioning than did victims of other types of TFSV. The current study provides partial support for the gender similarities hypothesis that TFSV is not exclusively a gender-based harm; our findings suggest that women and men’s TFSV experiences are similar for most TFSV types. Overall, the present study demonstrates the negative impact TFSV has for both women and men and highlights the need for greater awareness and increased support for all victims of this form of sexual violence.",2021-11-08T18:12:34.754104+00:00,"sexual harassment,mixed methods,sexual violence,gender,technology,internet abuse",,,"Amanda champion, Flora Oswald, Cory Pedersen, Devinder Khera",psyarxiv
E0101-0D4-1EE,Delineating non-consensual sexual image offending: Towards an empirical approach,"The topic of non-consensual sexual images has become an increasingly important issue within the social policy landscape. Social and legal scholars have advocated for these behaviours to be designated sexual offences due to the mode of perpetration of these behaviours, but are explicit in their rejection of a sexual element being important in the motivations underpinning such behaviours. However, this rejection is inconsistent with the core theoretical models related to sexual offending. In this article, we outline some of the potential psychological concepts that may help us to understand how and why people engage in a range of non-consensual sexual image offences, such as revenge pornography, upskirting, deepfake media production, and cyber-flashing. In doing so, we aim to begin to bridge the gap between legal scholars and psychological scientists, and develop a more comprehensive and theoretically coherent approach to studying this important social topic.",2019-06-12T19:58:21.005041+00:00,"upskirting,courtship disorder,cyber-flashing,non-consensual sexual images,dick pics,sexual offending,deepfake,revenge pornography,exhibitionism,pornography",,,"Craig A.

E003B-D9B-A86,Understanding Image-Based Sexual Abuse through Greek Public and Legal Lenses: A Constructionist Thematic Analysis,"Image-Based Sexual Abuse (IBSA), including deepfake sexual abuse - where fake yet lifelike sexual content is generated of non-consenting persons - constitutes a growing form of digitally mediated gender-based violence that remains largely under-researched within non-Anglophonic contexts. This study explores how IBSA is constructed and perceived by both laypeople and lawyers in Greece, a Southern European setting characterised by economic precarity, traditional gender norms, and evolving yet challenging legal frameworks. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with 21 participants either originating from or living in Greece (n = 16 lay persons, n = 5 legal professionals), we employed constructionist thematic analysis to examine how participants discursively frame IBSA, its motivations, barriers to reporting, legal challenges, and preventative measures. Five themes were identified: (1) constructions of IBSA as gendered violence motivated by control, humiliation, and financial exploitation; (2) barriers to reporting shaped by shame, stigma, and widespread mistrust in police institutions; (3) legal barriers related to financial inaccessibility and fragmented, outdated legal frameworks; (4) the central role of informal support networks alongside calls for education and public awareness; and (5) deepfake technologies as an emergent form of economic exploitation, particularly impacting sex workers within a legal vacuum. The findings highlight the need for structurally informed, context-sensitive responses to IBSA that address the intersections of gender, law, technology, and economic vulnerability.",2025-07-03,,,,"Anastasia Rousaki, Dean Fido",psyarxiv
E00C0-653-6D6,What Do We Know About the Mental Health of Porn Performers? A Systematic Literature Review,"Purpose: Much has been debated about the impact pornography has on the health of those who consume it. But how is it affecting the people starring in it? Performing in porn is a unique profession which requires a person to have sex with other—often unfamiliar—people in front of a camera for a living, comes with various kinds of stigma, and is accompanied by several health risks for professionals and amateurs. This brief report compiles available evidence on the mental health of performers in porn. Design/methodology/approach: This paper employs the PRISMA approach to systematically review existing research from health sciences and psychology to provide an overview of what is known about mental health in porn performers. Findings: Only three US studies examine the topic and none of them are recent, which may be due to porn performers being a population which has been described as hard to reach for researchers. The existing knowledge on performers’ mental health is inconclusive at best, but points toward significantly poorer mental health and higher prevalence of mental disorders in some, but not others. New general research on the topic is needed to close this gap. More importantly, granular investigation into which populations are at risk of developing poor mental health and due to which circumstances is needed as a basis to support vulnerable performers. Originality: This is the first systematic review compiling existing evidence on mental health of porn performers. An approach to address this lack of research is proposed.",2022-01-24T15:27:09.406933+00:00,"porn actor,sex work,porn,porn performer,mental health,porn actress",,,Hannes Jarke,psyarxiv
E00FE-A4F-A03,Why Do You Watch This Rough Stuff? Understanding Women's Paradoxical Pornography Preferences,"Different sources show a notable interest among women in pornographic themes related to dominance and submission, including non-consensual sexual encounters. This phenomenon has been labeled a paradox. To research factors driving the use of such pornography, we adopted a comprehensive biopsychosocial approach. Our study involved an online sample of 571 women, designed to be demographically close to age and education levels in Germany. Participants were exposed to consensual or non-consensual literature-based pornographic stimuli, and their sexual arousal was assessed. Additionally, we examined various traits encompassing societal influences (rape myth acceptance, prior use of violent sexual pornography) and biological-evolutionary factors (sex drive, K-factor, onset of menarche). Our findings revealed significant main effects of rape myth acceptance and sex drive on sexual arousal in response to both stimuli. Prior consumption of violent sexual pornography demonstrated an interaction, suggesting potential desensitization to more conventional pornographic content. Traits associated with life history, such as the K-factor and the onset of menarche, did not influence sexual arousal. These results prompt a discussion within the context of proximate influences, such as socialization. Our interpretation does not support the notion of a minority engaging in fast life history strategies among women, as suggested in prior research.",2023-10-15T12:15:09.956232+00:00,"pornography preferences,female sexual behavior,non-consensual pornography",,,"Maximilian T.

E00F4-2A8-B2A,Exploring perceptual similarity and its relation to image-based spaces: an effect of familiarity,"One challenge in exploring the internal representation of faces is the lack of controlled stimuli transformations. Researchers are often limited to verbalizable transformations in the creation of a dataset. An alternative approach to verbalization for interpretability is finding image-based measures that allow us to quantify image transformations. In this study, we explore whether PCA could be used to create controlled transformations to a face by testing the effect of these transformations on human perceptual similarity and on computational differences in Gabor, Pixel and DNN spaces. We found that perceptual similarity and the three image-based spaces are linearly related, almost perfectly in the case of the DNN, with a correlation of 0.94. This provides a controlled way to alter the appearance of a face. In experiment 2, the effect of familiarity on the perception of multidimensional transformations was explored. Our findings show that there is a positive relationship between the number of components transformed and both the perceptual similarity and the same three image-based spaces used in experiment 1. Furthermore, we found that familiar faces are rated more similar overall than unfamiliar faces. That is, a change to a familiar face is perceived as making less difference than the exact same change to an unfamiliar face. The ability to quantify, and thus control, these transformations is a powerful tool in exploring the factors that mediate a change in perceived identity.",2021-05-21T23:05:01.820147+00:00,"pca,face recognition,similarity,perceptual space,image-based spaces,familiarity",,,"Rosyl Somai, Peter JB Hancock",psyarxiv
E00DE-3F4-A36,Gloss discrimination: Towards an image-based perceptual model,"Gloss is typically considered the perceptual counterpart of a surface’s specular reflectance characteristics, much as color is the perceptual counterpart of a surface’s diffuse reflectance spectrum. In many contexts, it is tempting to ask how discriminable two surfaces are on the basis of their reflectance properties. Yet, as we argue here, this is a poorly-posed question, as factors other than reflectance (e.g., lighting, shape, viewpoint) can have substantial effects on how discriminable two images of glossy surfaces are to human participants. This fundamental difficulty with predicting gloss discrimination, whether from a physical measurement or from proximal image data, has so far hobbled efforts to establish a rigorously defined perceptual standard for surface gloss, similar to those that exist for color. Here, we propose an experimental framework for making this problem tractable, starting from the premise that any perceptual standard of gloss discrimination must account for how distal scene variables influence the statistics of proximal image data. With this goal in mind, we rendered a large set of images in which shape, illumination, viewpoint, and surface roughness were varied. For each combination of viewing conditions, a fixed difference in surface roughness was used to create a pair of images showing the same object (from the same viewpoint and under the same lighting) with high and low gloss. Human participants (N=150) completed a paired comparisons task in which they were required to select image pairs with the largest apparent gloss difference. Importantly, rankings of the scenes derived from these judgments represent differences in perceived gloss independent of physical reflectance. We find that these rankings are remarkably consistent across participants, and are well predicted by a straightforward Visual Differences Predictor (Daly, 1992; Mantiuk et al., 2023). This allows us to estimate reasonable bounds on visual discriminability for a given surface across a wide range of viewing conditions. This has potential applications in both vision science, computer graphics and industrial contexts.",2024-07-07T19:16:38.837877+00:00,,,,"James Ferwerda, Jacob Raleigh Cheeseman, Roland Fleming, Takuma Morimoto",psyarxiv
E0075-5E5-87C,Neural Mechanisms of the Rejection-Aggression Link,"Social rejection is a painful event that often increases aggression. However, the neural mechanisms of this rejection-aggression link remain unclear. A potential clue may be that rejected people often recruit the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex’s (VLPFC) self-regulatory processes to manage the pain of rejection. Using functional MRI, we replicated previous links between rejection and activity in the brain’s mentalizing network, social pain network, and VLPFC. VLPFC recruitment during rejection was associated with greater activity in the brain’s reward network (i.e., the ventral striatum) when individuals were given an opportunity to retaliate. This retaliation-related striatal response was associated with greater levels of retaliatory aggression. Dispositionally aggressive individuals exhibited less functional connectivity between the ventral striatum and the right VLPFC during aggression. This connectivity exerted a suppressing effect on dispositionally aggressive individuals’ greater aggressive responses to rejection. These results help explain how the pain of rejection and reward of revenge motivate rejected people to behave aggressively.",2018-03-19T17:29:09.462697+00:00,"exclusion,revenge,fmri,reward,self-regulation,pain,vlpfc,taylor aggression paradigm,ventral striatum,brain,neuroimaging,frontostriatal,aggression,aggressive behavior,pleasure,retaliatory aggression,cyberball,neuroscience,retaliation,social rejection",,,"C.

E0239-DEE-4B3,The Role of Positive Affect in Aggression,"Aggressive behavior hurts us all and is studied across psychology’s sub-disciplines. Classical theories discuss the causes of aggression in the context of negative affect (e.g., frustration, pain). However, more recent research implicates positive affect as an important correlate and cause of aggression. Such aggressive pleasure likely evolved from ancient predatory tendencies that later yielded reproductive benefits, holds across reactive and proactive forms of aggression, and is used strategically as an item in many people’s emotion-regulation toolkit. Findings from psychological and neural sciences have converged to detail aggression's hedonically pleasant qualities and the motivational and biological mechanisms through which they occur. This new approach generates novel hypotheses and might lead to effective interventions that mollify mankind’s aggressive tendencies.",2017-08-09T17:45:01.087035+00:00,"reward,aggressive behavior,positive affect,motivation,violence,revenge,pleasure,aggression,violent behavior",,,David Chester,psyarxiv
E0084-2DD-95E,"Personality Correlates of Revenge-Seeking: Multidimensional Links to Physical Aggression, Impulsivity, and Aggressive Pleasure","People differ in how much they seek retribution for interpersonal insults, slights, rejections, and other antagonistic actions. Identifying individuals who are most prone towards such revenge-seeking is a theoretically-informative and potentially violence-reducing endeavor. However, we have yet to understand the extent to which revenge-seeking individuals exhibit specific features of aggressiveness, impulsivity, and what motivates their hunt for retribution. Toward this end, we conducted three studies (total N = 673), in which revenge-seeking was measured alongside these other constructs. Analyses repeatedly demonstrated that revenge-seeking was associated with greater physical (but not verbal) aggressiveness, anger, and hostility. Revenge-seeking’s link to physical aggression was partially accounted for by sadistic impulses toward enjoying aggression and the tendency to use aggression to improve mood. Dominance analyses revealed that such sadistic impulses explained the most variance in revenge-seeking. Revenge-seeking was associated with greater impulsive responses to negative and positive affect, as well as greater premeditation of behavior. These findings paint a picture of revenge-seekers as physically aggressive curators of anger, whose retributive acts are performed with planned malice and motivated by the act’s entertaining and therapeutic qualities.",2017-11-16T14:02:21.233084+00:00,"traits,vengeance-seeking,positive urgency,vengeance,anger,premeditation,sadism,negative affect,gender,positive affect,personality,dominance analyses,mood,aggression,impulsivity,big five,anger rumination,revenge,negative urgency",,,"David Chester, C.

E0005-052-25C,Some Revenge Now or More Revenge Later? Applying an Intertemporal Framework to Retaliatory Aggression,"Retaliatory aggression is a rewarding behavior. Decisions about rewarding behaviors often involve an intertemporal bias, such that people prefer immediate rewards and discount delayed rewards. We integrated these literatures to test whether the delay discounting framework could be applied to retaliatory aggression. Across six studies (total N = 1,508), participants repeatedly chose between immediate-but-lesser or delayed-but-greater retaliation. As with other rewards (e.g., money), participants preferred immediate-but-lesser retaliation, discounting the value of delayed-but-greater revenge. Rates of aggression discounting were temporally stable and associated with greater aggressive behavior. Experimentally-induced angry rumination reduced discounting rates, motivating participants to wait longer to inflict greater harm. Participants with greater antagonistic traits (e.g., physical sadism), displayed stronger preferences for delayed-but greater vengeance. These findings suggest that some dispositionally aggressive individuals may delay retaliation in service of greater future revenge. Our results bolster the important role of reward in retaliatory aggression and suggest that an intertemporal framework is likely a fruitful area of investigation for antisocial behavior. We discuss the implications of our findings in relation to contemporary theories of aggression and broader theories of antisocial behavior.",2021-07-30T19:28:06.415987+00:00,"itap,delay discounting,mcq,acq,retaliation,aggression,retaliatory aggression,impulsivity,revenge",,,"Nayaab Khan, David Chester, Samuel James West, Calvin Hall, Emily Lasko",psyarxiv

Consequently, extrinsic reward should diminish revengeful cravings. One hundred fourteen participants received either insulting or praising feedback from another individual, were led to believe that they or the other individual won an unexpected monetary reward, and then indicated how much they desired revenge. Participants who received insulting feedback desired revenge more than praised counterparts, yet insulted participants who won the reward desired revenge less than those who did not win. This evidence emphasizes the need for personal satisfaction as fuel for revenge as well as highlights the importance of balancing the scales in retribution seeking.",2021-10-12T08:33:20.018078+00:00,"provocation,revenge,reward",,,"Blazej Mrozinski, Karolina Dyduch-Hazar",psyarxiv
E022B-030-244,Punishment Is Strongly Motivated by Revenge and Weakly Motivated by Inequity Aversion,"There are two broad functional explanations for second-party punishment: fitness-leveling and deterrence. The former suggests that people punish to reduce fitness differences, while the latter suggests that people punish in order to reciprocate losses and deter others from inflicting losses on them in the future. We explore the relative roles of these motivations using a pre-registered, two-player experiment with 2,426 US participants from Amazon Mechanical Turk. Participants played as the “responder” and were assigned to either a Take or Augment condition. In the Take condition, the “partner” could steal money from the responder’s bonus or do nothing. In the Augment condition, the partner could augment the responder’s bonus by giving them money at no cost to themselves or do nothing. We also manipulated the responders’ starting endowments, such that after the partner’s decision, responders experienced different payoff outcomes: advantageous inequity, equality, or varying degrees of disadvantageous inequity. Responders then decided whether to pay a cost to punish the partner. Punishment was clearly influenced by theft and was most frequent when theft resulted in disadvantageous inequity. However, people also punished in the absence of theft, particularly when confronted with disadvantageous inequity. While the effect of inequity on punishment was small, our results suggest that punishment is motivated by more than just the desire to reciprocate losses. These findings highlight the multiple motivations undergirding punishment and bear directly on functional explanations for the existence of punishment in human societies.",2020-06-15T21:18:31.685209+00:00,"fitness-leveing,deterrence,competition,revenge,punishment,inequity aversion",,,"Mark Bracic, Nichola Raihani, Paul Deutchman, Katherine McAuliffe",psyarxiv
E013A-045-245,Aggression As Successful Self-Control,"A dominant narrative is that aggression starts when self-control stops --- unchecked aggressive impulses manifest in violence as self-control fails to inhibit them. Yet this ‘low self-control syndrome’ approach to aggression fails to accommodate numerous findings in which aggression arises from successful self-control. I summarize these key findings while identifying how current theories of aggression can be molded to accommodate them. This balanced perspective, which allows aggression to arise from successful and unsuccessful self-control, suggests exciting new hypotheses alongside confounding questions for aggression and self-regulation scholars. It also supports ongoing and broader paradigm shifts away from treating self-control as a purely adaptive and desirable psychological capacity and toward approaching self-control interventions with greater care, as they may amplify aggression instead of reducing it, with costly consequences.",2023-02-16T03:32:13.855378+00:00,"violence,impulse control,self-control,revenge,aggression,aggressive behavior,self-regulation",,,David Chester,psyarxiv

Analyses of 101 nationally representative samples from three continents (N = 139,266) revealed a positive association between perceived levels of repression and intentions to engage in antigovernment violence. Additional analyses of fine-grained data from three countries characterized by widespread repression and antigovernment violence (N = 2,960) identified a positive association between personal experience with repression and intentions to engage in antigovernment violence. Randomized experiments revealed that memories about repression also motivate participation in antigovernment violence.

E0169-DC7-EB6,Perceptual judgements are resistant to the advisor's perceived level of trustworthiness: a deep fake approach,"As we navigate our environment, we often make spontaneous judgments about others. Trustworthiness is a key characteristic that we judge instantly and then use when making decisions, especially when we are uncertain. While the effect of trustworthiness on social behaviour has been extensively investigated, it remains unclear how trustworthiness affects more ‘basic’ cognitive processes such as perceptual decision-making. The present study aims to fill this gap. In the first experiment (N = 100), we validated a new trustworthiness manipulation by using deep fake technology to create animated versions of perceptually trustworthy, untrustworthy, and neutral static computer-generated faces. In the second experiment (N = 199), the deep fake procedure was applied to a new set of trustworthy and untrustworthy faces that served as advisors during a perceptual decision-making task. Here participants had to indicate the direction of dots that were either moving coherently to the left or to the right (i.e., random dot motion task). Contrary to our predictions, participants did not follow the advice of the trustworthy advisors more often than the advice of the untrustworthy advisors. We did find that participants decided faster and were more confident when following the advice, but this was also not influenced by the trustworthiness of the advisors. We integrate our findings within theoretical frameworks of advice taking, domain specificity of facial trustworthiness, and task requirements.",2024-05-09T12:35:09.876570+00:00,"deep fake,faces,social cognition,trustworthiness,advice taking,perceptual decision making",,,"Sam Verschooren, Marcel Brass, Mathias Van der Biest, Frederick Verbruggen",psyarxiv
E0071-DDA-89C,Seeing is Believing: The Continued Influence of a Known AI-Generated 'Deepfake' Video,"Advances in artificial intelligence mean it is becoming easier to create highly realistic deepfake videos, which can appear to show someone doing or saying something they did not in fact do or say. Deepfakes may present a threat to individuals and society: for example, deepfakes could be used to influence elections by discrediting political opponents. Psychological research suggests that people cannot reliably identify deepfakes and thus can be influenced by their content. However, little is yet known about the potential impact of a deepfake video which has been explicitly identified and flagged as fake. We explored this issue with two preregistered studies in which participants were shown a bespoke deepfake video of a man appearing to admit to committing a crime. Participants were then asked questions about the man’s guilt, to test how they had been influenced by the video’s content. We found that most participants relied on the content of a deepfake video, even when they had been explicitly warned beforehand that it was fake. This result was observed even with participants who indicated that they believed the warning and knew the video to be fake. We also found this specific warning to be no more effective than a generic warning about the existence of deepfake videos. Our findings suggest that identifying and flagging deepfake videos will not entirely negate their influence. This has implications for legislators, policy makers, and regulators of social media platforms and online news.",2024-05-23T11:27:21.719145+00:00,"artificial intelligence,deepfake,misinformation,social media,psychology",,,"Simon Clark, Stephan Lewandowsky",psyarxiv

Using videos from the Deepfake Detection Challenge, we investigated DDP in two unique observer groups: Super-Recognizers (SRs) and ""normal"" officers from within the 18K members of the Berlin Police. SRs were identified either via previously proposed lab-based procedures or the only existing tool for SR identification involving increasingly challenging, authentic forensic material: the Berlin Test For Super-Recognizer Identification (beSure®). Participants judged either pairs of videos, or single videos in a 2-alternative forced-choice decision setting (i.e., which of the pair, or whether a single video was a deepfake or not). We explored speed-accuracy trade-offs, compared DDP between lab-identified SRs and non-SRs, and police officers as a function of their independently measured face identity processing (FIP) ability. Interestingly, we found no relationship between DDP and FIP ability. Further work using static deepfakes created with current state-of-the-art generative models is needed to determine the value of SR deployment for deepfake detection in law enforcement.",2024-01-13T20:21:39.496175+00:00,"law enforcement,policing,super-recognizers,deepfake detection,facial identity processing",,,"Matthew J Vowels, Matthew Groh, Meike Ramon",psyarxiv

E00E5-A00-48F,Investigating relationships between moral foundations and support for revenge,"Revenge is a complex phenomenon that has long attracted attention from scholars across
disciplines. In two pre-registered studies, we applied insights from moral foundations theory to
examine how moral values are associated with attitudes toward revenge. In Study 1 (N = 299),
endorsement of the binding foundations (loyalty, authority, and purity) was positively associated
with support for revenge, whereas endorsement of the individualizing foundations (harm and
fairness) was negatively associated. Study 2 (N = 852), which focused on a specific case of
sexual assault, revealed a more nuanced pattern: individualizing values were linked to justifying
the victim’s revenge and attributing responsibility to the perpetrator, while binding values were
linked to blaming the victim for engaging in revenge. Together, these findings demonstrate a
novel application of moral foundations theory to the study of retribution, offering new insight
into the moral correlates of when, and for whom, revenge is viewed as legitimate.",2025-09-29,"Binding Values,Individualizing Values,Moral Foundations,Revenge,Victim Blaming",,,"Zhaoquan Wang, Liane Young, Stylianos Syropoulos, Kyle Fiore Law",psyarxiv
E014D-8CB-36E,Facial Expression is Retained in Deep Networks Trained for Face Identification,"Facial expressions distort visual cues for identification in two-dimensional images. Face processing systems in the brain must decouple image-based information from multiple sources to operate in the social world. Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) trained for face identification retain identity-irrelevant, image-based information (e.g., viewpoint). We asked whether a DCNN trained for identity also retains expression information that generalizes over viewpoint change. DCNN representations were generated for a controlled dataset containing images of 70 actors posing 7 facial expressions (happy, sad, angry, surprised, fearful, disgusted, neutral), from 5 viewpoints (frontal, 90-degree and 45-degree left and right profiles). Two-dimensional visualizations of the DCNN representations revealed hierarchical groupings by identity, followed by viewpoint, and then by facial expression. Linear discriminant analysis of full-dimensional representations predicted expressions accurately (72% correct for happiness, followed by surprise, disgust, anger, neutral, sad, and fearful at 39%; chance = 14.29%). Expression classification was stable across viewpoints. Representational similarity heatmaps indicated that image similarities within identities varied more by viewpoint than by expression. We conclude that an identity-trained, deep network retains shape-deformable information about expression and viewpoint, along with identity, in a unified form—consistent with a recent hypothesis for ventral visual stream processing.",2020-05-19T16:52:44.997543+00:00,"linear discriminant analysis,deep network,emotion,object recognition,neural network,karolinska,facial expression,computer vision,face recognition,t-sne,expression",,,"ALICE O'TOOLE, Y.

E00C9-744-B93,Deepfaked online content is highly effective in manipulating people’s attitudes and intentions,"In recent times, disinformation has spread rapidly through social media and news sites, biasing our (moral) judgements of other people and groups. “Deepfakes”, a new type of AI-generated media, represent a powerful new tool for spreading disinformation online. Although Deepfaked images, videos, and audio may appear genuine, they are actually hyper-realistic fabrications that enable one to digitally control what another person says or does. Given the recent emergence of this technology, we set out to examine the psychological impact of Deepfaked online content on viewers. Across seven preregistered studies (N = 2558) we exposed participants to either genuine or Deepfaked content, and then measured its impact on their explicit (self-reported) and implicit (unintentional) attitudes as well as behavioral intentions. Results indicated that Deepfaked videos and audio have a strong psychological impact on the viewer, and are just as effective in biasing their attitudes and intentions as genuine content. Many people are unaware that Deepfaking is possible; find it difficult to detect when they are being exposed to it; and most importantly, neither awareness nor detection serves to protect people from its influence.

Here, we leveraged existing theorizing in the area of sexual offending proclivity to systematically develop and validate of a measure of beliefs about revenge pornography. Using a large international community sample (N = 511) we found our ‘Beliefs about Revenge Pornography Questionnaire (BRPQ)’ to be comprised of three underpinning domains: ‘Victims as Responsible’, ‘Sociological Explanations’, and ‘Revenge Pornography as a Sexual Offense’. Concurrent validity is demonstrated through relationships with trait empathy, belief in a just world, dark personality traits, and rape myth acceptance. Randomly dividing the sample, we also show that the BRPQ predicts both revenge pornography proclivity (n = 227) and social judgements of this type of offending (n = 233).

In this study I exploit Google searches for ""symptoms"", ""unemployment"" and ""news"" as a proxy for how much people are worried about their health and economic situation and the amount of news they consume, respectively. I then use an integrable nonautonomous Lotka-Volterra model to study the interactions among these searches in three U.S. States (Mississippi, Nevada and Utah), the District of Columbia and in the U.S. as a whole. I find that the results are very similar in all areas analyzed, and for different specifications of the model. Prior to the pandemic outbreak the interactions among health worry, economic worry and news consumption are very weak. However, from around the beginning of the pandemic these interactions intensify greatly, and unemployment predates searches for news and for symptoms. Conversely, news and symptoms proceed in mutualism.

The present study examined how deepfake quality, media literacy, and attitudes toward the person depicted in the video shape individuals’ ability to detect political deepfakes, their emotional responses (liking), and behavioral intentions (social media sharing). A total of 1,124 participants from the United Kingdom, Slovenia, and Italy viewed manipulated videos about climate change and immigration that varied in quality. The results showed that high-quality deepfakes were less likely to be detected and received more positive evaluations than low-quality ones. In contrast, quality did not significantly influence sharing intention. Media literacy and attitudes toward the person in the video emerged as strong predictors across outcomes; higher media literacy improved detection and reduced liking and sharing, while more positive attitudes decreased detection and increased both liking and sharing. Mediation analyses demonstrated that liking partially mediated the link between detection and sharing intention. Furthermore, moderated mediation models revealed that this indirect effect was stronger among individuals with high media literacy (for climate change videos) and favorable attitudes toward the video’s subject (for both topics). Overall, the study highlights the need for interventions that address not only detection skills but also emotional and motivational susceptibility to persuasive synthetic media.

E0164-77F-86D,Mindfulness-based relapse prevention trial for compulsive sexual behaviour disorder,"Background and aims: Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder (CSBD) is a medical condition that can impair social and occupational functioning and lead to severe distress. To date, treatment effectiveness studies of CSBD are under-developed; typically, treatment for CSBD is based on guidelines for substance or other behavioural addictions. Mindfulness-based relapse prevention (MBRP) is an evidence-based treatment for substance addiction aimed at, among other things, reducing craving and negative affect—i.e. processes that are implicated in the maintenance of problematic sexual behaviours. However, to our knowledge no prior research has been published evaluating mindfulness-based intervention in the treatment of CSBD, except two clinical case reports. Therefore, the aim of the current preliminary research was to examine whether MBRP can lead to clinical improvement in CSBD. Methods: Participants were 13 adult males with a diagnosis of CSBD. Before and after the eight-week MBRP intervention, participants completed a booklet of questionnaires including measurements of porn viewing, masturbation and emotional distress. Results: As expected, we found that after MBRP participants spent significantly less time engaging in problematic pornography use and exhibited a decrease in anxiety, depression and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Discussion and Conclusions: The findings indicate that MBRP could be beneficial for CSBD individuals. Further clinical effectiveness studies with bigger sample sizes, delayed post-training measurements and randomised control trial design are warranted. In conclusion, MBRP leads to a decrease in time spent watching porn and a decrease in emotional distress in CSBD patients.",2020-03-23T23:32:24.192212+00:00,"csbd,addiction,mindfulness-based relapse prevention,mbrp,porn addiction,mindfulness",,,"Pawel Holas, Karol Lewczuk, Małgorzata Draps, Ewelina Kowalewska, Mateusz Gola",psyarxiv
E001C-1FF-3E1,Labeling Synthetic Content: User Perceptions of Warning Label Designs for AI-generated Content on Social Media,"In this research, we explored the efficacy of various warning label designs for AI-generated content on social media platforms—e.g., deepfakes. We devised and assessed ten distinct label design samples that varied across the dimensions of sentiment, color/iconography, positioning, and level of detail. Our experimental study involved 911 participants randomly assigned to these ten label designs and a control group evaluating social media content. We explored their perceptions relating to 1) Belief in the content being AI-generated, 2) Trust in the labels and 3) Social Media engagement perceptions of the content. The results demonstrate that the presence of labels had a significant effect on the user’s belief that the content is AI-generated, deepfake, or edited by AI. However their trust in the label significantly varied based on the label design. Notably, having labels did not significantly change their engagement behaviors, such as ’like’, comment, and sharing. However, there were significant differences in engagement based on content type: political and entertainment. This investigation contributes to the field of human-computer interaction by defining a design space for label implementation and providing empirical support for the strategic use of labels to mitigate the risks associated with synthetically generated media.",2025-02-20T11:57:42.989521+00:00,"warning labels,content labels,#ai content,deepfake images,deepfakes",,,"Arosha Bandara, Dilki, Dilrukshi Gamage, Min Zhang",psyarxiv

Both methods yielded comparable associations of 2D:4D with a range of sexually differentiated personality measures, including the Big Five, aggression, hypermasculinity, and self-esteem (partly additionally assessed with implicit tasks and peer-ratings complementing the self-report measures). Directly ascertained 2D:4D was significantly less precisely measurable and significantly higher than 2D:4D ascertained from images by the same observers. In particular, measurement method impacted fingers differentially: directly measured index vs ring fingers were 1% vs 2% shorter, thereby yielding higher 2D:4D than when measured from images. Finger differences in fingertip size have been hypothesized to account for such discrepancies. However, fingertip size is unrelated to 2D:4D. Alternatively, diminished finger extensibility in supinated hand position (when taking direct measurements), as compared with finger extensibility in pronated hand position (when taking palmar-view hand images), might account for these observations. For anatomical reasons, this effect should be stronger for ring fingers than for index fingers and moreover should increase with age.

Conspiracy believers were more likely to report relying less on social information than actually relying less on social information in the behavioral tasks.

However, there are many practical barriers to the development of creativity in schools, universities and workplaces. Chief among these is a problem of the fitness-for-purpose of creativity assessments. Highly valid and reliable creativity tests, necessary to support the development of individual creativity, are typically slow and labor-intensive to administer and score. However, recent advances in machine learning are opening up solutions to the fitness-for-purpose problem, across a range of different modes (e.g., verbal and figural) of testing. This paper describes the development of a large, image-based, multi-label classification model capable of automatically scoring the figural Test of Creative Thinking – Drawing Production (TCT-DP) with accuracies comparable to those of typical human raters.

Yet, empirical research examining the overlap among these domains is limited. The present analysis aims to address the lack of empirical research on the relationship between misogyny, violent extremism, and interpersonal violence by conducting survey-based analyses employing a newly developed and validated psychometric scale to measure misogyny. Based on a UK nationally representative survey (n = 1500), we examine the underlying mechanisms and contingent effects linking misogyny to violent extremism and interpersonal violence. We investigate how misogyny, frustrated narcissistic entitlement, and group threats among men translate into revenge motivation and hypermasculinity and thus, may increase violent extremist intentions and attitudes, as well as justification of and willingness to engage in interpersonal violence. The results show that misogyny predicts violent extremist attitudes and intentions as well as increased support for and willingness to engage in interpersonal violence via revenge planning and hypermasculinity, particularly among men who experience frustrated narcissistic entitlement and greater threats to the ingroup. Among women, misogyny is not associated with violent extremist attitudes or intentions but is associated with increased support for and readiness to use violence. Our findings have important practical implications as we provide evidence which articulates when and for whom misogyny may be a risk factor for violent extremism and interpersonal violence. Establishing the relevance of misogyny as a risk factor for (extremist) violence may provide evidence for more targeted prevention and intervention programs.",2021-08-13T17:20:18.984355+00:00,"collective narcissism,hypermasculinity,group threats,misogyny,violent extremism,terrorism,revenge motivation",,,"Caitlin Clemmow, Bettina Rottweiler, Paul Gill",psyarxiv

E021F-3BF-A07,Objecting to consensual experiments even while approving of nonconsensual imposition of the policies they contain,"In previous survey studies using decision-making vignettes in which respondents rated and ranked the appropriateness of universally implementing one intervention for all relevant people (A), universally implementing another intervention (B), or conducting an experiment (or A/B test) to compare these interventions before implementing the superior one, we have found that people are often averse to the A/B test, even when they approve of implementing either of the interventions the experiment contains (Meyer et al., 2019, Heck et al., 2020). However, these vignettes did not say explicitly whether or not consent to the A/B test—or to universal imposition of either A or B, untested—would be obtained. In a preregistered analysis, when we asked respondents in four of our previous survey experiments to explain their ratings, 18% of those who rated the A/B test commented negatively on the apparent lack of consent, compared to fewer than 1% of participants who rated the A or B conditions offering the same objection (Meyer et al., 2019). Because implementing A and implementing B, collectively, entail imposing the same risks on people as conducting an A/B test, this contrast is puzzling. Moreover, pragmatic trials of the sort our vignettes describe are often not feasible to conduct with consent; as a result, IRBs often waive the default requirement of consent and ethicists have also argued that consent to research is not always required. Here, in three studies using previous materials, we test the effect on experiment aversion (Heck et al., 2020; cf. Mislavsky et al., 2019) and the A/B effect (Meyer et al., 2019) of stipulating that consent to the A/B test either will or will not be obtained. In both vignettes we test, we find that negative sentiments towards experiments persist even when it is explicitly stated that consent will be obtained. While these negative sentiments are substantially reduced when consent is present (compared to when consent is absent or not mentioned), significant experiment aversion and A/B effects remain: 29–31% of participants were averse to the experiment and 32–39% ranked it as the worst decision the agent could make—even when consent would be obtained from everyone involved in the A/B test and from no one involved in either policy imposition.",2023-03-31T21:08:31.681810+00:00,"informed consent,pragmatic trial,field experiment,research ethics,experiment,trial,rct,a/b effect,consent,experiment aversion",,,"Randi L.

We report findings of four studies conducted with American and Polish individuals. Results showed that individuals who have more positive attitudes toward anger are higher in trait anger (Studies 1- 4), are more likely to think about getting revenge (Study 1), and expect that getting revenge will make them feel good (Studies 1 - 2). In addition, these individuals are lower in agreeableness and lower in the tendency to engage in avoidance when angered (Studies 1 - 4). They score lower in humility (Studies 3 - 4), lower in secure romantic attachment but higher in anxious and avoidance attachment (Study 3). Finally, they are more likely to believe a wide range of conspiracies (Studies 2 - 4).

E01DD-770-81D,Enhancing Human Detection of Real and AI-Generated Hyperrealistic Faces,"Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have prompted concerns about the proliferation of deepfake content—synthetic images, audio, and videos—online. StyleGan2, a powerful generative adversarial network architecture, can generate synthetic images of human faces that appear more realistic than actual human faces—a phenomenon termed AI hyperrealism. Across four preregistered experiments (total N = 661), we tested whether a novel behavioral intervention, termed DISCERN-AI, improved people’s ability to discriminate between real and synthetic StyleGan2 images. DISCERN-AI combines instructions about which visual features are diagnostic for classifying real and synthetic images with an inductive learning training protocol. In Experiment 1, participants completed a pre-test, DISCERN-AI, and a post-test. In Experiment 2, participants underwent DISCERN-AI or a control task before completing a post-test. In Experiments 3A and 3B, participants completed a shortened version of the intervention or control task, followed by an immediate post-test and a second post-test after 20 days. In all experiments, participants showed below-chance discrimination performance (AI hyperrealism) in the pre-test and control conditions. After completing DISCERN-AI, however, participants consistently showed above-chance discrimination performance, even when tested after 20 days. Together, the results provide support for an easily scalable intervention that substantially improves people’s ability to discriminate between real and synthetic StyleGan2 images.",2025-02-27T19:03:39.270656+00:00,"face perception,deepfake detection,ai hyperrealism,generative ai,artificial intelligence (ai),roc analysis",,,"Philip Anthony Higham, Mansi Pattni, Tina Seabrooke",psyarxiv
E0192-5D5-B65,Outrage Fatigue? Cognitive Costs and Decisions to Blame,"Across nine studies (N=1,672), we assessed the link between cognitive costs and the choice to express outrage by blaming. We developed the Blame Selection Task, a binary free-choice paradigm that examines the propensity to blame transgressors (versus an alternative choice)—either before or after reading vignettes and viewing images of moral transgressions. We hypothesized that participants’ choice to blame wrongdoers would negatively relate to how cognitively inefficacious, effortful, and aversive blaming feels (compared to the alternative choice). With vignettes, participants approached blaming and reported that blaming felt more efficacious. With images, participants avoided blaming and reported that blaming felt more inefficacious, effortful, and aversive. Blame choice was greater for vignette-based transgressions than image-based transgressions. Blame choice was positively related to moral personality constructs, blame-related social-norms, and perceived efficacy of blaming, and inversely related to perceived effort and aversiveness of blaming. The BST is a valid behavioral index of blame propensity, and choosing to blame is linked to its cognitive costs.",2021-11-30T07:23:43.161744+00:00,"blame,effort,moral outrage,choice,efficacy",,,"Daryl Cameron, Veerpal Bambrah, Michael Inzlicht",psyarxiv
E0136-C57-BCB,The visual information available in virtual reality,"Perception in virtual reality is often compared to the perception of pictures. There are, however, important differences. A virtual reality environment, unlike a picture, is interactive and immersive. These properties give rise to novel theoretical challenges. Building on James J. Gibson's analysis of the perception of depictions, we raise three questions about perception in virtual reality, to which we offer tentative answers: 1) Is virtual reality a kind of picture perception? Answer: No. A virtual reality headset is better understood not as an image-based display but as a pair of electronic spectacles that allow the wearer to sample a simulated ambient optic array. 2) Who creates the information in virtual reality? Answer: The information is a joint creation of hardware developers, software engineers, and the observer. The observer is a co-creator of the information that they detect. 3) Are there affordances in virtual reality? Answer: Yes, but there are limitations on what a given virtual reality environment can provide to its users, resulting from the details of how the environment is implemented. An accurate understanding of the perceptual information available in virtual reality may contribute to current philosophical debates on the nature of experience in virtual reality.",2024-02-22T13:27:47.531541+00:00,"affordances,video games,ecological film theory,virtual reality,ecological optics,ecological psychology,picture perception",,,"Edward Baggs, Paweł Grabarczyk, Zuzanna Rucińska",psyarxiv
E0025-7C6-D68,Multimodal prior knowledge determines false memory formation,"Memory formation is a complex phenomenon shaped by various experiential traces, yet their exact contributions remain unclear. This study investigates the generation of false memories leveraging different data-driven computational models to independently quantify language-based and vision-based experiential knowledge, as extracted from large-scale databases consisting of 639 billion words and 15 million images, respectively. We then tested the effects of these knowledge sources in two false-memory experiments, one employing images and the other words as stimuli. Our findings unveil both modality-independent and modality-dependent processes in the formation of memory traces. Indeed, we observed a contribution of both prior visual and linguistic knowledge regardless of the types of stimuli to be memorised. However, the extent of this contribution differed as a function of the modality tested: visual prior knowledge is more influential in image-based tasks, while linguistic prior knowledge dominates in word-based tasks. This dual and modality-dependent contribution underscores the adaptive nature of memory processes, revealing the dynamic integration of diverse experiential traces in false memory formation.",2025-08-28,"Deese-Roediger-McDermott,False Memory Generator,False memories,language-based similarity,multimodal prior knowledge,vector-based models,vision-based similarity",,,"Daniele Gatti, Marco Marelli, Luca Rinaldi, Francesca Rodio, Marco Alessandro Petilli",psyarxiv
E022B-670-C57,The Social Media Use Scale: Development and Validation,"Social media (SM) use has been primarily operationalized as frequency of use or as passive versus active use. We hypothesize that these constructs have shown mixed associations with psychological constructs because the factor structure underlying social media use (SMU) has not been fully identified. We conducted three studies with college students. In Study 1 (N=176), we collected data about participants’ SMU, informing item generation. In Study 2 (N=311), we tested two factor structures: (1) passive, active social, and active non-social and (2) a hypothesized four-factor structure. Neither confirmatory model produced acceptable fits, but an exploratory factor analysis suggested a four-factor model: Belief-based, consumption-based, image-based, and comparison-based SMU. This four-factor structure was supported in Study 3 (N=397), which was preregistered, via a confirmatory factor analysis. The subscale items showed good internal consistencies, and evidence is presented for convergent validity. These factors represent a novel classification of people’s SMU that can be measured with the Social Media Use Scale.",2023-05-02T00:16:56.206825+00:00,"questionnaire,measure,scale,social media,social media types,social networking sites",,,"Alison Tuck, Renee Thompson",psyarxiv
E015C-A2C-8E3,Navigating image space,"Navigation means getting from here to there. Unfortunately, for biological navigation, there is no agreed definition of what we might mean by `here' or `there'. Computer vision (`Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping', SLAM) uses a 3D world-based coordinate frame but that is a poor model for biological spatial representation. Another possibility is to use an image-based rather than a map-based representation where the observer moves relative to a fixation point. This would require a system for relating different fixation points to one another as the observer moves through the environment. I describe how this can be done by, first, relating fixations to an egocentric representation of visual direction and, second, encoding egocentric representations in a coarse-to-fine hierarchy. The coarsest level of this hierarchy is, in some sense, a world-based frame as it does not vary with eye rotation or observer translation. This representation could be implemented as a `policy', a term used in reinforcement learning to describe a set of states and associated actions, or a `graph' that describes how images or sensory states can be connected by actions. I discuss some of the psychophysical evidence relating to these differing hypotheses about spatial representation and navigation.",2025-01-17T13:30:57.026445+00:00,"navigation,fixation,moving observer,grid cells,spatial representation,optic flow,3d vision",,,Andrew Glennerster,psyarxiv
E01D3-B7B-DB4,"Individual Deep Fake Recognition Skills are Affected by Viewers’ Political Orientation, Agreement with Content and Device Used","AI-generated “deep fakes” are becoming increasingly professional and can be expected to become an essential tool for cybercriminals conducting targeted and tailored social engineering attacks, as well as for others aiming for influencing public opinion in a more general sense. While the technological arms race is resulting in increasingly efficient forensic detection tools, these are unlikely to be in place and applied by common users on an everyday basis any time soon, especially if social engineering attacks are camouflaged as unsuspicious conversations. To date, most cybercriminals do not yet have the necessary resources, competencies or the required raw material featuring the target to produce perfect impersonifications. To raise awareness and efficiently train individuals in recognizing the most widespread deep fakes, the understanding of what may cause individual differences in the ability to recognize them can be central. Previous research suggested a close relationship between political attitudes and top-down perceptual and subsequent cognitive processing styles. In this study, we aimed to investigate the impact of political attitudes and agreement with the political message content on the individual’s deep fake recognition skills. In this study, 163 adults (72 females = 44.2%) judged a series of video clips with politicians’ statements across the political spectrum regarding their authenticity and their agreement with the message that was transported. Half of the presented videos were fabricated via lip-sync technology. In addition to the particular agreement to each statement made, more global political attitudes towards social and economic topics were assessed via the Social and Economic Conservatism Scale (SECS). Data analysis revealed robust negative associations between participants’ general and in particular social conservatism and their ability to recognize fabricated videos. This effect was pronounced where there was a specific agreement with the message content. Deep fakes watched on mobile phones and tablets were considerably less likely to be recognized as such compared to when watched on stationary computers. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate and establish the association between political attitudes and interindividual differences in deep fake recognition. The study further supports very recently published research suggesting relationships between conservatism and perceived credibility of conspiracy theories and fake news in general. Implications for further research on psychological mechanisms underlying this effect are discussed.",2021-12-30T14:24:35.177365+00:00,"fake news,deepfakes,conservatism,deep fakes,recognition,political orientation,cybercrime,perception,social media,social engineering",,,"Matthew Canham, Leandra Wolf, Torvald F.

E0022-B40-817,"What is ""where"": Physical reasoning informs object location","A central puzzle the visual system tries to solve is: “what is where?” While a great deal of research attempts to model object recognition (“what”), a comparatively smaller body of work seeks to model object location (“where”), especially in perceiving everyday objects. How do people locate an object, right now, in front of them? In three experiments collecting over 35,000 judgements on stimuli spanning different levels of realism (line drawings, real images, and crude forms), participants clicked “where” an object is, as if pointing to it. We modeled their responses with eight different methods, including both human response-based models (judgements of physical reasoning, spatial memory, free-response “click anywhere” judgements, and judgements of where people would grab the object), and image-based models (uniform distributions over the image, convex hull, saliency map, and medial axis). Physical reasoning was the best predictor of “where,” performing significantly better than even spatial memory and free-response judgements. Our results offer insight into the perception of object locations while also raising interesting questions about the relationship between physical reasoning and visual perception.",2023-03-21T19:25:32.914557+00:00,"physical reasoning,object representation,perception",,,"Tomer Ullman, Tal Boger",psyarxiv
E01D7-FE8-450,Volitional control of piloerection: objective evidence and its potential utility in neuroscience research,"The ability of volitional control of piloerection has been reported in a rare subset of individuals. This ability may be useful to study involuntary emotional piloerection, as research on this phenomenon has suffered from low reproducibility. However, objective evidence at a group-level and stability under experimental constraints remain to be examined. The present study aimed to validate existing findings of voluntary generated piloerection (VGP) and to examine its potential contribution to neuroscientific research based on objective evidence of this ability. In Study 1, to confirm the characteristics of VGP reported in previous studies and identify individuals with VGP capability, an online survey of VGP candidates found through a large-scale screening was conducted. In Study 2, a total of 18 VGP holders participated in a mail-based piloerection measurement experiment, and the nature of VGP was examined based on the objective evidence obtained by image-based analysis (GooseLab). The results of the web survey largely recapitulated the characteristics of VGP reported in previous studies, and objective measurements revealed the utility of this ability in neuroscientific research. For some participants, VGP appeared to be emotionally promoted, which suggests that VGP shares the emotional nature of involuntary piloerection. The findings from this study demonstrated the possible contribution of VGP to elucidating the mechanism of involuntary emotional piloerection and the neural basis of piloerection itself.",2019-10-29T08:01:18.515457+00:00,"volitional control,emotion,piloerection,objective measurement,autonomic,goose bumps",,,"Ai Kawakami, Noriko Nagata, Akitoshi Tomita, Kenji Katahira",psyarxiv
E0097-83B-07F,Mental imagery and its role in the psychopathology and treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder: a systematic review and narrative synthesis,"Whilst intrusive mental imagery represents a diagnostic feature of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), research is lacking with most focussing on intrusive thoughts. Moreover, it has been argued that mental imagery might represent a unique form of OCD symptomatology and could be harnessed to treat symptoms. We performed a systematic review, adopting a two-phased approach, to examine the role of mental imagery in both the psychopathology and treatment of OCD. First, we explored the characteristics and pathological features of intrusive imagery in OCD. Second, we evaluated literature examining imagery-based interventions, i.e., Imagery Rescripting (ImRs) and Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR), in treating symptoms. Findings identify distressing mental imagery as a prominent feature in OCD. Intrusive imagery in OCD was characterised as vivid distressing visual images often accompanied by bodily sensations. Compared to other anxiety disorders, intrusive imagery in OCD occurred more frequently, which often led people to believe they possessed a “dangerous self”. Up to 89% of OCD patients reported experiencing intrusive imagery, with 70% to 79% also reporting that the intrusions related to adverse or traumatic events. Image-based treatments like ImRs and EMDR were found to be promising in reducing symptoms, providing an effective alternative treatment for patients suffering intrusive imagery.",2025-03-19,,,,"Michael Bloomfield, Alexandra Badaoui, Chris Brewin, Margherita Zenoni, James Bisby, Stephanie Archer, Amy L Milton",psyarxiv

intercourse, is examined in this study within the broader context of heterosexual sexuality,
intergender power dynamics, and contraceptive negotiation. This research aims to explore the

Through in-depth interviews with ten women who have experienced stealthing, this study
highlights its sexual, reproductive, and mental health consequences. Results: The participants,
aged 19 to 58, reside in urban areas of Brazil. Using thematic analysis, the findings reveal the
complex power dynamics within relationships, leading to various outcomes, including the pursuit
of emergency contraception, experiences of pregnancy and abortion, exposure to sexually
transmitted infections, lack of institutional support, and significant mental health impacts.
Conclusions: The invisibility of stealthing in the Brazilian context presents challenges for open

E01E3-564-38E,"Thanking, Apologizing, Bragging, and Blaming: Responsibility Exchange Theory and the Currency of Communication","From the time we are children, we are taught to say “thank you” and “I’m sorry.” These communications are central to many social interactions, and the failure to say them often leads to conflict in relationships. Research has documented that, alongside the impact they can have on relationships, apologies and thanks can also impact material outcomes as small as restaurant tips and as significant as settlements of medical malpractice lawsuits. But, it is trivial to utter the words; how can such “cheap talk” carry so much value? In this paper, we propose a “responsibility exchange theory” that explains why these communications are not costless, and which draws connections between four forms of communication that have not previously been connected: thanking, apologizing, bragging, and blaming. All four of these communications relay information about credit or blame, and thus introduce image-based costs and benefits for both the communicator and the recipient of communication: Each of the four communications involves a tradeoff between appearing competent and appearing warm. By formalizing these social psychological insights with a utility-based approach to modeling communication, and by applying game theoretic analysis, we offer new insights about social communication. We test several of the model’s novel predictions about strategic communication in two experiments: The first involves hypothetical choices in a scenario study, and the second involves real choices in a live interaction. We end with a discussion of the theory’s place in the literature and consider extended predictions and applications as examples of future directions for research.",2017-09-12T14:19:08.346599+00:00,"interpersonal communication,politeness,warmth and competence,impression management,incivility,credit and blame,conflict management,interpersonal relationships,responsibility attribution,self-presentation,social image concern,signaling,person perception",,,"George Loewenstein, Shereen Jehan Chaudhry",psyarxiv
E021C-C37-106,Modeling the effects of perisaccadic attention on gaze statistics during scene viewing,"How we perceive a visual scene depends critically on the selection of gaze positions by a series of saccadic eye movements (scan path). In this selection process, visual attention is known to play a key role in two ways. First, models of image-based visual attention are able to predict the time-independent eye-fixation density. Second, millisecond-level attentional dynamics around the time of saccade drives our gaze from one position to the next. These two related research areas on attention are typically perceived as separate, both theoretically and experimentally. Here we link the two research areas by demonstrating that perisaccadic attentional dynamics improve predictions on scan path statistics in scene viewing. In a dynamical mathematical model, we identified two new theoretical principles to be essential, (i) perisaccadic covert attention for the explanation of a saccadic momentum effect and (ii) delayed inactivation of recently fixated regions for facilitation of return saccades. Our model reproduces saccade amplitude distributions, angular statistics, intersaccadic turning angles, and their impact on fixation durations as well as inter-individual differences between observers. Results are obtained from data assimilation of the mathematical model in a fully Bayesian framework that permitted rigorous statistical inference. We conclude that bridging the gap between static visual attention models and perisaccadic attentional dynamics is important for the prediction of human scene exploration behavior.",2020-04-08T08:33:05.480374+00:00,"scan path,attention,attention modelling,eye movement,fixation modelling,scenewalk,eye tracking,modelling",,,"Hans Trukenbrod, Lisa Schwetlick, Lars Rothkegel, Ralf Engbert",psyarxiv
E022C-761-F4E,Visual intuitions in the absence of visual experience: the role of direct experience in concreteness and imageability judgements,"The strongest formulations of grounded cognition assume that perceptual intuitions about concepts involve the re-activation of sensorimotor experience we have made with their referents in the world. Within this framework, concreteness and imageability ratings are indeed of crucial importance by operationalising the amount of perceptual interaction we have made with objects. Here we tested such an assumption by asking whether visual intuitions about concepts are provided accurately even when direct visual experience is absent. To this aim, we considered concreteness and imageability intuitions in blind people and tested whether these judgments are predicted by Image-based Frequency (IF, i.e. a data-driven estimate approximating the availability of the word referent in the visual environment). Results indicated that IF predicts perceptual intuitions with a larger extent in sighted compared to blind individuals, thus suggesting a role of direct experience in shaping our judgements. However, the effect of IF was significant not only in sighted but also in blind individuals. This indicates that having direct visual experience with objects does not play a critical role in making them concrete and imageable in a person’s intuitions: people do not need visual experience to develop intuition about the availability of things in the external visual environment and use this intuition to inform concreteness/imageability judgments. Our findings fit closely the idea that perceptual judgments are the outcome of introspection/abstraction tasks invoking high-level conceptual knowledge that is not necessarily acquired via direct perceptual experience.",2023-06-04T21:15:49.722159+00:00,"blindness,visual experience,perceptual ratings,grounded cognition,concreteness,imageability",,,"Marco Alessandro Petilli, Marco Marelli",psyarxiv

E0250-B1A-56A,The effect of intrinsic image memorability on recollection and familiarity,"Many photographs of real-life scenes are very consistently remembered or forgotten by most people, making these images intrinsically memorable or forgettable. Although machine vision algorithms can predict a given image’s memorability very well, nothing is known about the subjective quality of these memories: are memorable images recognized based on strong feelings of familiarity or on recollection of episodic details? We tested people’s recognition memory for memorable and forgettable scenes selected from image memorability databases, which contain memorability scores for each image, based on large-scale recognition memory experiments. Specifically, we tested the effect of intrinsic memorability on recollection and familiarity using cognitive computational models based on Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROCs; Experiment 1 and 2) and on remember/know (R/K) judgments (Experiment 2). The ROC data of experiment 1 indicated that image memorability boosted memory strength, but did not find a specific effect on recollection or familiarity. By contrast, ROC data from Experiment 2, which was designed to facilitate encoding and, in turn, recollection, found more evidence for a specific effect of image memorability on recollection. Moreover, R/K judgments showed that, on average, memorability boosts recollection rather than familiarity. However, we also found a large degree of variability in these ratings across individual images: some images actually achieved high recognition rates by exclusively boosting familiarity rather than recollection. Together, these results show that current machine vision algorithms that can predict an image’s intrinsic memorability in terms of hit rates fall short of describing the subjective quality of human memories.",2019-09-18T12:15:07.846266+00:00,,,,"Niko Busch, Nico Broers",psyarxiv
E0038-66C-00E,"Representations of Health and Wellness on Instagram: An Analysis of 285,000 Posts","Image-based social media is experiencing a significant increase in popularity among adolescents and young adults (Pew Research Center, 2018). On Instagram, Health Influencers share magazine-ready images that communicate health and wellness to millions of followers. These images have been criticized by academics and the public alike as self-promotional, lacking a scientific basis, and promoting Western beauty standards and thin-ideals. Given Health Influencers' considerable social reach and mounting concern that certain types of Instagram content can negatively affect young people’s mental health and body image, it is important to assess the social costs of their posting habits. While empirical research has identified types of posts that contribute to body image issues (e.g., selfies exhibiting naked body parts), research on the prevalence of these posts in health messages on Instagram is more limited. To this end, we analyzed the most frequently used hashtags of 784 Health Influencers with ten-thousand or more followers and fit an unsupervised topic model to over 285,000 of their posts. This analysis revealed that a majority of health and wellness content on Instagram is related to four themes: Cosmetics and Appearance, Self-promotion, Fitness, and General Wellness. Furthermore, while many posts appear to promote health habits (e.g., vegan food recipes or posts of inspiration and encouragement), a substantial number of images contain content previous research has suggested can lead to body-image and self-esteem issues (e.g., photos promoting thin-body ideals).

E00DD-007-4E0,Average faces: How does the averaging process change faces physically and perceptually,"Average faces have been used frequently in face recognition studies, either as a theoretical concept (e.g., face norm) or as a tool to manipulate facial attributes (e.g., modifying identity strength). Nonetheless, how the face averaging process— the creation of average faces using an increasing number of faces —changes the resulting averaged faces and our ability to differentiate between them remains to be elucidated. Here we addressed these questions by combining 3D-face averaging, eye-movement tracking, and the computation of image-based face similarity. Participants judged whether two average faces showed the same person while we systematically increased their average level (i.e., number of faces being averaged). Our results showed, with increasing averaging, both a nonlinear increase of the computational similarity between the resulting average faces and a nonlinear decrease of face discrimination performance. Participants’ performance dropped from near-ceiling level when two different faces had been averaged together to chance level when 80 faces were mixed. We also found a nonlinear relationship between face similarity and face discrimination performance, which was fitted nicely with an exponential function. Furthermore, when the comparison task became more challenging, participants performed more fixations onto the faces. Nonetheless, the distribution of fixations across facial features (eyes, nose, mouth, and the center area of a face) remained unchanged.

Previous efforts to explore high-level vision, independent of shape influence, involved meticulous measurements to control for perceptual shape similarity across distinct stimulus sets. However, there is a compelling need for a more efficient approach to automatically synthesize perceptually uniform spaces of novel shapes. In this pursuit, we present an image-based method that autonomously generates numerous perceptually uniform and circular shape sets, eliminating the need for extensive psychophysical measurements. Our method employs a search for circular shape sets correlated with ShapeComp, an image-computable shape similarity metric based on over 100 descriptors, highly predictive of human shape similarity. Using multi-arrangement methods, we demonstrate that predicted human similarity arrangements of shape sets defined as circular and uniformly spaced by ShapeComp, align with human shape similarity judgments and approximate circularity. Notably, shape sets chosen for uniformity and circularity in alternative shape spaces (e.g., Generative Adversarial Networks or Radial Frequency patterns), but not meeting these criteria in ShapeComp, did not necessarily register as perceptually uniform and circular. Therefore, leveraging ShapeComp, we introduce an automated method for generating extensive sets of perceptually uniform and circular shape spaces. We provide five newly validated circular shape sets derived from intricate naturalistic shapes, along with MATLAB code facilitating the creation of a limitless number of such sets. This advancement empowers cognitive scientists to construct large sets of perceptually uniform stimuli, allowing for a nuanced exploration of the impact of higher-level factors on object perception.",2025-02-28T10:10:42.925989+00:00,"computational modelling,object perception,visual similarity,shape similarity,perceptually uniform,circular shape space",,,"Ana Belen Carbajal Chavez, Johan Wagemans, Eline Van Geert, Yaniv Morgenstern",psyarxiv
E0220-823-36D,Using AI to Generate Affective Images: Methodology and Initial Library,"This project aims to advance affective science by leveraging generative artificial intelligence (AI) to create a publicly accessible database of affect induction images: Library of AI-Generated Affective Images (LAI-GAI). Current limitations in image-based research include weak to moderate emotional elicitation effects, limited image diversity, and minimal cultural tailoring of images. First, we built a pipeline for utilizing generative AI to develop affective images that capitalized on existing datasets and emotion definitions. Second, using the pipeline, we developed a library of images (n = 480) and their descriptions across 12 discrete emotion categories. The project employed a human-in-the-loop approach to refine and validate these stimuli, ensuring their effectiveness and cultural relevance. We validated the library through three international studies involving 1,611 participants from 44 countries, who rated three types of images: (1) images from existing affective databases, (2) AI-generated images without cultural adjustments, and (3) AI-generated images adjusted to specific cultural contexts. The AI-generated images were as effective in eliciting affective responses as the images from existing affective databases. The culturally adjusted images were slightly more effective in eliciting targeted affective responses compared to their counterparts unadjusted to participants' cultural context. Furthermore, we calculated the smallest effect sizes of interest for affect induction research (d’s from 0.06 to 0.31). This work demonstrates that researchers can now generate high-quality affect induction stimuli cost-effectively and at scale, and tailor them to diverse contexts—overcoming longstanding barriers and laying the groundwork for future AI-driven methodologies in affective science.",2025-06-25,"Affect,Affect Induction Procedures,Emotion,Generative Artificial Intelligence,Image Database",,,"James Gross, Rafał Jończyk, Shan, Eli Rice, Dominika Kunc, Rohmotul Islam, Arooj Najmussaqib, Szymon Jęśko-Białek, Patryk Maciejewski, Maciej Kłoskowski, Nicholas A.

E01C3-BDC-45C,The importance of stimulus variability when studying face processing using Fast Periodic Visual Stimulation: A novel ‘Mixed-Emotions’ paradigm,"Fast Periodic Visual Stimulation (FPVS) with oddball stimuli has been used to investigate discrimination of facial identity and emotion, with studies concluding that oddball responses indicate discrimination of faces at the conceptual level (i.e. discrimination of identity and emotion), rather than low-level perceptual (visual, image-based) discrimination. However, because previous studies have utilised identical images as base stimuli, physical differences between base and oddball stimuli, rather than recognition of identity or emotion, may have been responsible for oddball responses. This study tested two new FPVS paradigms designed to distinguish recognition of expressions of emotion from basic detection of visual change. In both paradigms, the oddball emotional expression was different from that of the base stream images. However, in the 'fixed-emotion' paradigm, stimulus image varied at every presentation but the emotion in the base stream remained constant, and in the 'mixed-emotions' paradigm, both stimulus image and emotion varied at every presentation, with only the oddball emotion (disgust) remaining constant. In the fixed-emotion paradigm, typical inversion effects were observed at occipital sites. In the mixed-emotions paradigm, however, inversion effects in a central cluster (indicative of higher level emotion processing) were present in typical participants, but not those with alexithymia (who are impaired at emotion recognition), suggesting that only the mixed-emotions paradigm reflects emotion recognition rather than lower-level visual processing or basic detection of change. These results have significant methodological implications for future FPVS studies (of both facial emotion and identity), suggesting that it is crucial to vary base stimuli sufficiently, such that simple physical differences between base and oddball stimuli cannot give rise to neural oddball responses.",2018-11-09T11:33:29.608981+00:00,"fast periodic visual stimulation,implicit,alexithymia,facial expressions",,,"Geoffrey Bird, Michel-Pierre Coll, Rebecca Brewer, Caroline Catmur, Jennifer Murphy",psyarxiv
E0191-13D-974,The Effects of Eugenic Bias and Moral Emotions on Lay Legal Judgments in a Sterilization Case Involving Intellectual Disability,"Abstract
Objective:  To examine public opinion on a medical procedure involving the non-consensual sterilization of individuals with intellectual disabilities.
Method:  A mock jury design was employed with 213 participants (148 female) who evaluated a vignette describing a surgeon performing a tubal ligation on an intellectually disabled patient. The vignette varied across five experimental conditions by manipulating the presence of intellectual disability, genetic risk, and a judicial decision to remove the child from parental custody after birth. We assessed how emotions, moral judgments, the surgeon’s stated rationale, and underlying attitudes, including potential eugenic dispositions, influenced participants’ sentencing recommendations.
Results:  Findings revealed three distinct participant profiles. One group (the rejecters) consistently deemed the procedure wholly unjustifiable, expressing strong moral condemnation regardless of the surgeon’s explanation. A second group (the apologists) was more inclined to justify the sterilization when the rationale involved disability or potential genetic transmission, exhibiting lower moral outrage and stronger eugenicist attitudes. The third group (the contextual evaluators) offered more nuanced judgments by taking situational factors, such as child risk or insufficient parental support, into account, thereby prioritizing caregiving considerations over disability status alone.
Conclusions:  The study demonstrates that sentencing recommendations are shaped by emotional and moral responses to perceived genetic and child welfare risks. These findings have important implications for juror education, public policy, and the protection of reproductive rights for individuals with intellectual disabilities.",2025-05-20,,,,"Hakim Djeriouat, Eva VIVES, Astrid Thébault Guiochon, Agnès Falco, Bastien Trémolière",psyarxiv
E0008-7CE-489,Too tempting to resist? Self-control moderates the relationship between narcissism and antisocial tendencies,"Previous research highlights that narcissism predicts a wide range of antisocial tendencies. We propose that the expression of such tendencies is contingent on the level of dispositional self-control. Three independent studies (Ntotal = 1,458) using three different narcissism measures and self-reported as well as behavioral indicators of antisocial tendencies tested this moderation hypothesis. In Study 1, antagonistic narcissism was positively related to self-reported revenge following an interpersonal transgression and this relationship was weakened among individuals high (vs. low) in self-control. Studies 2 and 3 conceptually replicated this finding using different narcissism measures, respectively, and trait (Study 2) as well as behaviorally assessed aggression (Study 3) as outcome variables. Results support the moderating role of self-control in the antagonistic narcissism-antisociality link.",2021-11-25T11:31:52.865175+00:00,,,,"Ramzi Fatfouta, Radosław Rogoza, Katrin Rentzsch, Piotr Paweł Brud",psyarxiv
E0002-14F-7E4,"The ‘casting couch’ scenario: Impact of perceived employment benefit, reporting delay, complainant gender, and participant gender on juror decision-making in rape cases","Recent media reports of contemporary and historical rape and sexual assault cases have focused on the entertainment industry, particularly around the notion of the ‘casting couch’. This scenario, in which a powerful figure obtains sometimes non-consensual sexual acts from subordinate actors in exchange for employment, was used to explore the influence of rape myths and Sexual Economics Theory on mock-juror decision-making. Participant-jurors (n = 907) viewed video and written testimony of a complainant, accusing a male producer of rape. Complainant gender (male, female), delay before reporting the incident to the police (immediately, six months, ten years), and complainant casting in the production were randomly varied (acting role secured, not secured). The strongest effects were that females (79.7%) were significantly more likely than males (62.7%) to deliver a guilty verdict and to recommend longer prison sentences for the offence. When the complainant did not secure the acting role, and they delayed reporting the incident for six months, there was a trend for guilty verdict rates to be slightly higher when the complainant was male (80.5%) than female (64.5%). No interacting complainant gender effects on trial outcomes were found in the other delay conditions, or when the actor secured employment. Defendant guilt attributions to the male and female complainant were also differently influenced by rape myth belief levels and homophobic attitudes, but not beliefs in a just world. The casting couch euphemism, reported worldwide, suggests industry acceptance, and may sanitise the act of demanding sex and even committing rape. However, these results have important implications for any occupational setting in which men in positions of power may sexually exploit junior staff.",2019-08-19T19:39:52.980251+00:00,"sexual assault,juror decision making,casting couch,rape myths,jury decision making",,,"Shona Mcintosh, Josh P Davis",psyarxiv
E0181-958-587,Collective narcissism and its social consequences: The Bad and the Ugly,"Collective narcissism is a belief that one’s own group (the in-group) is exceptional but not sufficiently recognized by others. It is the form of ‘in-group love’ associated with ‘out-group hate’. In contrast to private collective self-esteem (a belief that the in-group is of high value), it consistently predicts prejudice, retaliatory intergroup aggression, and rejoicing in suffering of others. The pervasive association between collective narcissism and intergroup hostility is driven by a biased perception of intergroup situations that serves to protect undermined self-worth and frustrated personal entitlement invested in the in-group’s image. Collective narcissism is associated with hypersensitivity to provocation and the belief that only hostile revenge is a desirable and rewarding response. It arises when the traditional group-based hierarchies are challenged and empowers extremists as well as populist politicians. Instead of alleviating, it re-fuels a sense of threatened self-importance. The association between collective narcissism and intergroup hostility is weakened by experiences fortifying emotional resilience (e.g., positive identification with a community).",2020-02-10T17:55:43.836978+00:00,"populism,: collective narcissism,collective self-esteem,intergroup hostility,prejudice",,,"Dorottya Lantos, Agnieszka Golec",psyarxiv

In addressing this gap, we apply latent class analysis to develop an inductive event typology of public place violence. We analyze a sample of 500 police reported public assaults from Copenhagen, Denmark, which have been systematically coded for a range of situational and individual properties. Five event-types of public violence are identified—in addition to the well-known night-time economy related type, we found classes characterized by excessively violent behaviors; revenge among familiar persons; weapon use and severe victim injuries; and disrespect encounters in everyday contexts. We consider how our findings may evaluate the generalizability of key micro-interactional theories of violence, and discuss the implications of our typology for crime prevention.",2025-08-19,,,,"Peter Ejbye-Ernst, Lasse Suonperä Liebst, Richard Philpot, Marie Rosenkrantz Lindegaard, Kim Kristian Moeller, Marie Bruvik Heinskou, Camilla Bank Friis",psyarxiv
E00BE-730-C5E,"Empathy for Human and Non-Human Animal Pain: How Species Categorization, Pain Cues, and Psychosocial Traits Shape Pain Perception and Prosocial Intentions","Empathy for pain guides moral concern and prosocial behaviour, yet little is known about how it extends across species. This study examined how people perceive and respond to pain in humans, pets, and farmed animals, and how these responses relate to individual psychosocial traits. We developed and validated the Cross-Species Pain Empathy Task (C-SPET), the first image-based tool enabling direct comparison of pain perception and willingness to help across species. A total of 407 undergraduate participants rated perceived pain and support intentions after viewing images of wounded (pain) and non-wounded (no-pain) individuals from each species category. Participants reported greater willingness to help animals than humans, possibly due to perceptions of animals as more vulnerable. Within the animal category, when no pain was visible, farmed animals were perceived as suffering more and received more support than pets. Awareness of the typical living conditions of farmed animals may lead people to infer suffering even in the absence of pain cues. When pain was explicit, pets were perceived as suffering more and received more support than farmed animals. Pain cues may have triggered either emotional closeness toward pets or cognitive dissonance in response to farmed animal suffering, as this challenged participants’ everyday practices such as meat consumption. Canonical correlation analyses revealed two psychosocial profiles linked to pain sensitivity and prosocial intentions. A caring, pro-animal profile was associated with greater support for non-human animals. A second profile, reflecting emotional reactivity, religiosity, and cultural background, was linked to heightened pain sensitivity across species. Species-specific biases were shaped by distinct traits. Favouring animals over humans was associated with pro-animal attitudes, life choices, and lower prejudice, possibly reflecting a strategic moral prioritisation of often neglected groups. Favouring pets over farmed animals was linked to ethnicity, higher meat consumption, political conservatism, and social dominance orientation, suggesting a tendency to maintain traditional roles around animal categories. These findings highlight the psychosocial factors that shape pain empathy and caring behaviour across species.",2025-07-10,"Attitudes Toward Animals,Canonical Correlation Analysis,Empathy,Human-Animal,Human-Animal Relationships,Individual Differences,Non-Human Animals,Pain,Pain Empathy,Pain Perception,Pain in Others,Prosocial Behaviour,Social Cognition",,,"Marina López-Solà, Brock Bastian, Maria Sunol",psyarxiv
E00EC-6A3-D04,Cloned voices are easier to understand in noise than their human originals: the voice cloning intelligibility benefit,"Voice cloning technology has developed at an extremely rapid pace and recent work suggests the quality of synthesis now produces humanlike voices. Recent research on cloned voices focused on listeners’ capabilities to discriminate between cloned, ‘deepfake’ and human voices, due to perils associated with the misuse of this technology. However, the relative intelligibility of cloned and human voices is unknown. We compared the relative intelligibility ten human voices with their ten clones in background noise. Participants (N=80) listened to 80 sentences, 40 human and 40 cloned in +3dB, 0dB, -3dB and -6dB signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) in an online experiment. We found that cloned voices were more intelligible in noise than their human counterparts; up to 20% higher across all four noise levels. We also asked participants to rate the clarity and accent strength of all human and cloned voices; and asked participants to identify which voice was human in an 2AFC task. The cloned voices were rated as having marginally higher clarity and perceived to have a less standard accent. Participants identified the human voices with ~70% accuracy. The acoustic analysis of both types of voices revealed that the intelligibility benefit was linked to voice source characteristics including mean pitch and period variation, plus a smoother voice source and improved harmonic-to-noise ratio in the 500-3500 frequency range in the cloned voices. Our results have implications for applications of cloned voices, such as voice restoration, speech synthesis for non-verbal people, and for people with hearing loss.",2025-08-16,,,,"patti adank, Han Wang",psyarxiv
E01CE-B8D-28F,Polygamous Interest in a Mononormative Nation: The Roles of Sex and Sociosexuality in Polygamous Interest in a Heterosexual Sample From the UK,"Polygamy is a form of “one-sided” consensually non-monogamous relationship where one person has multiple committed partners, each of whom is only involved with that one person. It was likely a reoccurring feature of ancestral mating that posed adaptive problems for our ancestors. Yet polygamy, and multi-partnering more generally, is understudied in Western cultures, raising questions about the existence of polygamous interest and whether this is calibrated adaptively to personal condition. In two studies, we examined polygamous interest in two heterosexual online samples from the UK. In Study 1 (n = 393), modest interest was found for polygamous relationships overall. Men were six times more open to polygyny than women, but there was little sex difference in openness to polyandry. Further analysis revealed that all forms of multi-partnering were undesirable relative to singlehood and monogamy; however, consensual multi-partner relationships were less undesirable than non-consensual ones. Sex differences were largest for polygyny and arrangements where men had agreed access to a casual partner alongside a committed one, yet these were two of the most acceptable forms of multi-partnering when men and women’s responses were combined. Sociosexuality positively predicted interest in most forms of multi-partnering. Study 2 (n = 735) focused on polygyny and added status-linked traits as predictors. The results of Study 1 were broadly replicated, though the status-linked traits did not predict polygynous interest specifically. Instead, sociosexuality and male intrasexual competitiveness uniquely predicted general interest in multi-partner relationships. Overall, interest in polygamy appears to emerge despite social discouragement, and sex differences in interest track the relative costs and benefits associated with it. However, there is no strong evidence that polygamous interest is uniquely calibrated to personal condition when compared to other forms of multi-partnering.",2022-07-06T10:05:00.894891+00:00,"evolutionary psychology,polygyny,sex differences,polyandry,sociosexuality,consensual non-monogamy",,,"Steve Stewart-Williams, Sophie Harrison, Andrew G.

Poor sleep quality is associated with aggressive behavior, yet the psychological mechanisms that drive this effect are incompletely understood. We tested the prediction that the association between poor sleep quality and aggression would be explained, in part, by a magnified experience of positive affect during aggression. We conducted two cross-sectional studies (Study 1 N = 388; Study 2: N = 317) and a third preregistered study (N = 379), which tested for mediation across two waves that were separated by 14-42 days. Across all three studies, we replicated the positive association between poor sleep quality and aggression. However, we did not observe compelling or consistent evidence that poor sleep quality is linked to greater positive affect during aggression. Such aggressive pleasure was temporally-stable and predicted subsequent increases in aggressive behavior. These findings support a reinforcement model of aggressive affect, in which the pleasure of aggression promotes greater aggression over time ‒ perhaps explaining why some individuals are more dispositionally-aggressive than others.",2019-01-30T19:10:59.093583+00:00,"pleasure,social rejection,sleep quality,affect,aggression",,,"David Chester, Joseph Dzierzewski",psyarxiv
E0064-269-1FF,Digital Content Modalities and Adolescent Mental Health: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Video versus Non-Video Platform Effects,"Background: Rising adolescent mental health concerns have paralleled the proliferation of multimodal digital platforms, with short-form video consumption reaching unprecedented levels. Current research aggregates diverse social media platforms, potentially obscuring content-specific psychological mechanisms that may differentially impact mental health outcomes.

Objectives: To systematically examine how different digital content modalities (text, image, video) affect adolescent mental health outcomes, with particular focus on the psychological mechanisms linking short-form video platforms to anxiety and depression.

Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines. Electronic databases (PsychINFO, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus) were searched for studies published 2020-2024 examining digital content consumption and adolescent mental health. Inclusion criteria required adolescent participants (10-19 years), validated mental health measures, and content modality specification. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed using Cohen's d and odds ratios, with subgroup analyses by content type.

Results: Forty-seven studies met inclusion criteria (N=156,789 participants). Short-form video platforms showed significantly stronger associations with mental health outcomes (pooled d=0.45, 95% CI: 0.32-0.58) compared to image-based platforms (d=0.28, 95% CI: 0.18-0.38) and text-based platforms (d=0.21, 95% CI: 0.12-0.30). Video content demonstrated unique psychological pathways including enhanced parasocial relationships (d=0.35), intensified social comparison (d=0.48), and algorithm-driven attention disruption (d=0.33). Longitudinal studies revealed accelerated symptom development among video platform users compared to other modalities.

Conclusions: Digital content modality significantly influences adolescent mental health outcomes, with video platforms creating distinct psychological risks requiring targeted interventions. Current aggregated approaches to social media research may substantially underestimate video-specific effects. Clinical assessment and prevention programs should differentiate content modalities in their approaches.

Over the last twenty years, attention and research have been paid to the term narcissism 
personality disorder. The NPD is a concept classified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders (DSM-5) as a personality disorder characterized by grandiosity, a need for 
admiration, and a lack of empathy, as stated by the American Psychiatric Association 2013. A 
person with NPD creates a great challenge for the lives of those around them because these 
individuals fundamentally believe that they are mentally healthy and that others should try harder 
to understand them. In other words, a person with an inflated self-image, a deep need for admiration, 
and who considers themselves the center of the universe believes that the rest of humanity was 
created to serve the narcissistic person. Expanding awareness of their characteristics and trying to 
equip themselves with tactics that will reduce the damage of the NPD in the lives of those around 
them.  
This article defines the narcissistic personality and its types and discusses how NPDs defend 
themselves, take revenge, and their strategies. The following describes the personality of people 
who are usually suitable prey to narcissists, the victim's view of them, and how this personality 
selects these victims. At least Providing practical solutions with examples to maintain the mental

E00D2-570-002,Anger and its Consequences for Judgment and Behavior: Recent Developments in Social and Political Psychology,"In the eyes of the public—and in a substantial amount of scholarly research—anger is often framed in a negative light, given its role in driving people to act in antisocial ways. However, anger also has the potential for social good, insofar as it focuses attention on, and motivates people to fix, perceived injustices. As we discuss, the foundational link between anger and a desire to rectify justice has profoundly important implications that are relevant to research and theory in a variety of different disciplines (e.g., experimental social psychology, neuroscience, political science, personality). We begin this chapter by considering the methodological and theoretical challenges involved in the measurement of this feeling state, along with its relevance to our line of research on revenge, as well as the ideological consequences of threat. In the course of this discussion, we introduce a neo-Gibsonian framework of threat which allows for the fact that different types of threats, via anger, can exert different types of ideological consequences. A key prediction of this model—one that distinguishes it from current models of threat—is that activation of anger following threat has the potential to shift political attitudes to the “right” or to the “left”, depending on the nature of the threat at hand. These and other findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of this emotion, its relation to (perceived and actual) injustice, and its role in shaping relevant political beliefs.",2018-12-06T18:15:44.603562+00:00,"emotion,politics,anger,threat,political psychology,attitudes",,,"Alan Lambert, Fade Eadeh, Emily Hanson",psyarxiv
E00AA-430-D67,Cross-Societal Variation in Norm Enforcement Systems: A Review,"Across human societies, people are sometimes willing to punish norm violators. Such punishment can take the form of revenge from victims, seemingly altruistic intervention from third parties, or legitimized sanctioning from institutional representatives. Although prior work has documented cross-cultural regularities in norm enforcement, substantial variation exists in the prevalence and forms of punishment across societies. Such cross-societal variation may arise from universal psychological mechanisms responding to different socio-ecological conditions, or from cultural evolutionary processes, resulting in different norm enforcement systems. To date, empirical evidence from comparative studies across diverse societies has remained disconnected, due to a lack of interdisciplinary integration and a prevalent tendency of empirical studies to focus on different underpinnings of variation in norm enforcement. To provide a more complete view of the shared and unique aspects of punishment across societies, we review prior research in anthropology, economics, and psychology, and take a first step towards integrating the plethora of socio-ecological and cultural factors proposed to explain cross-societal variation in norm enforcement. We conclude by discussing how future cross-societal research can use diverse methodologies to illuminate key questions on the domain-specificity of punishment, the diversity of tactics supporting social norms, and their role in processes of norm change.",2023-07-28T12:35:38.712715+00:00,"punishment,culture,social norms,cross-cultural research",,,"Catherine Molho, Slewe, S.

E0062-B07-029,Authoritarianism in Action,"We propose a behavioral view of authoritarianism, and argue that the everyday psychology of rules and punishment is at its core. Authoritarianism is often understood at the nation-state level, categorizing particular regimes and practices as authoritarian, or at the individual level, as a set of tendencies or worldviews. We reposition behavior as the main unit of analysis. We specify a set of behaviors made available only when people interact with the state, and use state rules and state punishment to carry out their own desires (e.g., for revenge, dominance) at the expense of the rule of law. Then, we propose that at the heart of these authoritarian behaviors is regular, everyday psychology—the psychology of norms and norm enforcement via third party punishment, albeit formalized, codified, and refracted through state procedures. States solve large scale coordination problems, largely with codified rules and official third- party punishments. Sometimes people use these procedures to fairly and legitimately uphold the rule of law, and sometimes people use them for their own ends, amounting to authoritarianism. We review how the state channels human desires for punishment and rules, and how people can use state punishment and state rules to behave in authoritarian ways; State punishments can be administered selectively and personally. Official rules can be made that keep individuals from public services, or exist only to keep some people in positions of power over others. The psychology of norms and third party punishment, which enables large-scale human cooperation, is at the heart of authoritarianism.",2025-09-24,,,,"Connie Pui Yee Chiu, Nicolette Dakin, Jordan Wylie, Ana P.

E01C6-3AD-111,Personality Correlates of Dispositional Forgiveness: A Direct Comparison of Interpersonal and Self-Forgiveness Using Common Transgression Scenarios,"Although the personality correlates of dispositional interpersonal forgiveness (forgiveness of others) have been well characterized, those of dispositional self-forgiveness are less well understood. Moreover, when the personality correlates are examined for both types of forgiveness, the comparison has been based on participants’ self-report ratings on questionnaires. The current study sought to address these gaps in the literature by adopting a scenario-based approach, which has been used less frequently, especially in self-forgiveness research. A total of 160 participants read six fictional scenarios, each describing a severe transgression, from the perspective of the transgressor (self-forgiveness, n = 78) or the victim (interpersonal forgiveness, n = 82) of the transgression, and then responded to several items assessing different facets of forgiveness (avoidance, revenge, and benevolence). Participants’ personality (Big Five) and explanatory style were also assessed. Consistent with prior literature, agreeableness and neuroticism generally predicted different facets of interpersonal forgiveness. These two personality traits also predicted facets of self-forgiveness, but, additionally, conscientiousness and one’s tendency to internalize failure (the personal component of explanatory style) uniquely predicted self-forgiveness, especially avoidance motivations. These results point to both similarities and differences in the personality correlates for interpersonal and self-forgiveness. As a secondary, more exploratory aim, the current study compared the results from our scenario-based assessment of forgiveness to those based on a commonly used questionnaire, the Other and Self subscales of the Heartland Forgiveness Scale (HFS). As expected, the Other subscale of the HFS were associated with levels of interpersonal forgiveness assessed with our transgression scenarios, but, surprisingly, so were the HFS Self subscale. Moreover, the Self subscale was not associated with levels of self-forgiveness assessed with transgression scenarios, except for avoidance motivations. These results suggest that scenario-based and questionnaire-based methods may capture different facts of forgiveness and cannot be used interchangeably, especially for the assessment of self-forgiveness. More generally, the current study illustrates the importance of conducting direct within-study comparisons of interpersonal and self-forgiveness as well as of different assessment methods to better understand the similarities and differences between the two types of forgiveness.",2023-05-07T19:45:51.771290+00:00,"neuroticism,explanatory style,agreeableness,interpersonal forgiveness,self-forgiveness,big five,conscientiousness,forgiveness",,,"Nicholas Carruth, Lucas Hampton, Akira Miyake, John Lurquin",psyarxiv
E00CF-938-55E,"Exaggerated Misperceptions of Police, not Exaggerated Claims of Harmful Drug Effects on the Brain, is Killing Black People and Police: Reply to “Exaggerating Harmful Drug Effects on the Brain Is Killing Black People”","In a recent Neuron NeuroView article, Dr. Carl Hart raises concerns that drug research exaggerates detrimental effects on the brain, which contributes towards harmful stereotypes or toxicology reports being used to justify and legitimize police brutality and killing of black people. In Part 1, I review the cases that Hart mentions to support his central claim. I find they do not provide sufficient evidence that drugs play a systematic role in motivating, justifying or legitimizing police brutality or deadly force. Future studies of police-civilian interactions are required to prove or disprove the hypothesis. Hart uses the term ‘massacre’ to refer to police killings of black people, but offers little to no evidence that police are massacring black people. In Part 2, I review two large national officer-involved fatality databases and summarize studies of racial bias and policing. To date, there is very little to no systematic evidence for anti-black bias in police shootings or killings. In Part 3, I delineate a causal pathway and cite evidence to describe how widespread, distorted perceptions of police may paradoxically contribute towards hundreds of excess homicides and thousands of felonious crimes per year in the US. These violent crimes are committed against mostly black victims, thus exacerbating the cycles of violence and structural disadvantages of socioeconomically distressed minority communities. Hart also states recreational drugs have overwhelmingly positive effects and pose less danger than police, yet black people are ~400x more likely to die by drug overdose than by an unarmed encounter with police, which is comparable to the odds of being struck by lightning. Mass protests sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of police have raised awareness about police brutality and the need for police reform, but distorted perceptions of police, amplified by media bias and misinformation, have also led to mass rioting, looting, and the destruction of thousands of small businesses (many of which were black-owned). They have also fueled ambush revenge killings of more than 20 officers since 2014 and have increased officers’ concerns over their safety. I propose a systems level, causal network as an approach to model the public and mental health outcomes of high profile police brutality videos that includes complex interactions among psychosocial factors and the influences of misinformation and racial, media and political bias. The model may inform evidence-based strategies to ameliorate health inequities attributed to structural racism and suggests new avenues for research in these areas.",2020-10-27T07:38:39.851754+00:00,"racial bias,police use of force,systems psychology,evidence based advocacy,officer-involved shootings,racial disparity",,,Spiro P.
