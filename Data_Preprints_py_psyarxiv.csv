2m4da_v1,Judgements of Deepfake Sexual Abuse Victims Differ as a Function of Facial Versus Body Likenesses,"We are witnessing exponential growth in the use of machine learning to create fake – yet indistinguishable - sexual media of others without their consent. Though there is an emerging understanding of the impact that deepfake sexual abuse (DSA) has on its victims and societal understanding thereof, this knowledge pertains entirely to individuals whose facial likeness has been used within said material, with little-to-no attention paid to those whose bodies are used as the canvas; individuals who are predominantly sex workers. Across 321 participants (Mage = 45.70 years, SD = 15.88; 48.9% female), vignettes were used to explore differences in societal judgements of DSA for victims whose face (versus body) was used to generate DSA material, and whether they were labelled as a sex worker. Though perceived criminality did not differ across conditions, participants allocated more blame and less anticipated harm to DSA victims whose body, relative to whose face, was used. This effect was enhanced in vignettes labelling them as sex workers. When exploring correlations using demographics, beliefs, and personality traits, being older, male, and viewing sex work as ‘a choice’ and/or ‘deviant’ predicted greater victim blame, lower perceived criminality, and less anticipated harm. High self-reported empathy was the only predictor of greater anticipated harm. Results indicate the importance of understanding broader impacts of DSA - regardless of the victim - for stakeholders within the criminal justice system, and a continued need to generate public awareness of DSA through international policy.",2025-03-12T11:24:07.056983,"deepfake sexual abuse,image-based sexual abuse,OnlyFans,sex workers,technology-facilitated sexual violence",,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/2m4da_v1/,"Dean Fido, Harriet Goldfinch, Dominic Ruddy, Craig Harper",psyarxiv
b4fgc_v1,Understanding Image-Based Sexual Abuse through Greek Public and Legal Lenses: A Constructionist Thematic Analysis,"Image-Based Sexual Abuse (IBSA), including deepfake sexual abuse - where fake yet lifelike sexual content is generated of non-consenting persons - constitutes a growing form of digitally mediated gender-based violence that remains largely under-researched within non-Anglophonic contexts. This study explores how IBSA is constructed and perceived by both laypeople and lawyers in Greece, a Southern European setting characterised by economic precarity, traditional gender norms, and evolving yet challenging legal frameworks. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with 21 participants either originating from or living in Greece (n = 16 lay persons, n = 5 legal professionals), we employed constructionist thematic analysis to examine how participants discursively frame IBSA, its motivations, barriers to reporting, legal challenges, and preventative measures. Five themes were identified: (1) constructions of IBSA as gendered violence motivated by control, humiliation, and financial exploitation; (2) barriers to reporting shaped by shame, stigma, and widespread mistrust in police institutions; (3) legal barriers related to financial inaccessibility and fragmented, outdated legal frameworks; (4) the central role of informal support networks alongside calls for education and public awareness; and (5) deepfake technologies as an emergent form of economic exploitation, particularly impacting sex workers within a legal vacuum. The findings highlight the need for structurally informed, context-sensitive responses to IBSA that address the intersections of gender, law, technology, and economic vulnerability.",2025-07-03T10:04:19.946226,,,https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/b4fgc_v1/,"Anastasia Rousaki, Dean Fido",psyarxiv
