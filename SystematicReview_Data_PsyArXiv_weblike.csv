E023A-304-483,Examining Perceptions of Sextortion in the General Population,"The non-consensual sharing of sexual images of another (or threats thereof) represents an increasingly important and pervasive issue in forensic psychology. However, despite recent legislative developments within the United Kingdom, there still exists a need for greater understanding of perceptions within the general public of the dangers and manifestations of image-based sexual abuse and the process by which people are being (s)extorted using their private images. Ten participants (Mage = 24.8 years; SD = 9.33; 70% female) took part in semi-structured interviews which were analysed using an inductive thematic analytic approach, wherein the themes of [1] Education as a Prevention against Image Based Sexual Abuse, [2] Victim Blaming Prevalence in Society, [3] Stereotypes about Victim and Perpetrator, and [4] Low Priority for Criminal Justice were explored. Taken together, data suggests that although there exists a ‘working knowledge’ of image-based sexual abuse, the concept of sextortion is understood to a lesser extent with clear implications for the need for educational policies to better inform younger members of society of associated dangers and legalities.",2021-10-11T12:46:44.301696+00:00,"thematic analysis,image-based sexual abuse,sextortion,revenge pornography",,,"Dean Fido, Anisha Gohil",psyarxiv
E00BD-0A7-E14,Judgements of Deepfake Sexual Abuse Victims Differ as a Function of Facial Versus Body Likenesses,"We are witnessing exponential growth in the use of machine learning to create fake – yet indistinguishable - sexual media of others without their consent. Though there is an emerging understanding of the impact that deepfake sexual abuse (DSA) has on its victims and societal understanding thereof, this knowledge pertains entirely to individuals whose facial likeness has been used within said material, with little-to-no attention paid to those whose bodies are used as the canvas; individuals who are predominantly sex workers. Across 321 participants (Mage = 45.70 years, SD = 15.88; 48.9% female), vignettes were used to explore differences in societal judgements of DSA for victims whose face (versus body) was used to generate DSA material, and whether they were labelled as a sex worker. Though perceived criminality did not differ across conditions, participants allocated more blame and less anticipated harm to DSA victims whose body, relative to whose face, was used. This effect was enhanced in vignettes labelling them as sex workers. When exploring correlations using demographics, beliefs, and personality traits, being older, male, and viewing sex work as ‘a choice’ and/or ‘deviant’ predicted greater victim blame, lower perceived criminality, and less anticipated harm. High self-reported empathy was the only predictor of greater anticipated harm. Results indicate the importance of understanding broader impacts of DSA - regardless of the victim - for stakeholders within the criminal justice system, and a continued need to generate public awareness of DSA through international policy.",2025-03-12,"OnlyFans,deepfake sexual abuse,image-based sexual abuse,sex workers,technology-facilitated sexual violence",,,"Dominic Ruddy, Dean Fido, Harriet Goldfinch, Craig Harper",psyarxiv
E00D0-0EA-C6A,The Scientometrics of Child Sexual Exploitation Material Offending:  An Analysis of Fifty Years of Academic Research,"Child sexual exploitation material (CSEM) research is an increasingly important area of interdisciplinary study.  Key research areas include offenders and offending behavior; legal and societal issues; victimology; treatment; investigations; digital forensics; and deterrence.   Many publications are multidisciplinary, with fields including law, psychology, criminal justice, sociology, digital forensics, data analytics, and related areas.  This study examines the historical body of research on CSEM offending through a scientometric review.  The Web of Science Core Collection was searched for relevant research articles with no date restrictions, and 990 responsive papers published between 1979 and the present were identified.  The key authors in the field included Michael Seto (n=31, fc=10.87), Ethel Quayle (n=21, fc=7.49), and Kathryn Seigfried-Spellar (n=12, fc=7.17), with the paper “Prevalence and Characteristics of Youth Sexing: A National Study” by Mitchell et al. identified as the most cited.  Historiographical analysis identified works by Ethel Quayle and Max Taylor as well as Michael Seto as seminal papers in the field, and the United States (45.7%, n=452), the United Kingdom (29.2%, n=289), and Australia (23.6%, n=234) as the countries with the highest numbers of publications.  Keyword analyses found the terms child pornography and indecent images decreasing over time, and the terms CSEM and child sexual abuse images increasing in usage.",2025-05-31,Scientometrics; Child Sexual Exploitation Material; Child Sexual Abuse Material,,,Chad M.S.

E0165-17D-8A8,Intrasexual competition as a predictor of women’s judgements of revenge pornography offending,"Recent legislative developments have led to a marked increase in the empirical investigation of motivations and judgements of so-called acts of ‘revenge pornography’ offending. In two independently-sampled studies, we used moderation analyses to investigate whether higher levels of intrasexual competition predicted more lenient judgements of revenge pornography offences as a function of sex (Study 1, N = 241), and whether such relationships would be further moderated by physical attractiveness (Study 2, N = 402). Potential covariates of callous-unemotional traits, empathy, and victimization history were controlled for. Opposing our hypotheses, we consistently observed a trend for higher levels of intrasexual competition being associated with more lenient judgements of revenge pornography offences involving male victims by female participants. The results are discussed in terms of intrasexual competition potentially sharing variance with unobserved constructs in the wider sexological literature, and of the key relevance of these findings for future empirical investigation into judgements of non-consensual image-based offending.

E007E-C63-ED8,Understanding how survivors of non-consensual intimate image dissemination are perceived by UK and Norwegian respondents,"Purpose: In popular media, ‘revenge pornography’ refers to the non-consensual sharing of intimate images (NCSII) of another. Despite survivors of NCSII facing long-term consequences, they still face victim-blaming attitudes. Extant literature has typically sampled from countries where NCSII has long been illegal, such as the United Kingdom (UK); neglecting perspectives from countries lacking NCSII-specific legislation, such as Norway at the time of data collection. 
Methods: Participants (n = 477) from the UK and Norway responded to vignettes depicting NCSII, which differed by the survivor-perpetrator relationship depicted (i.e., casual vs. committed). 
Results: Controlling for participant sex and psychopathic personality traits (previously implicated in judgements of image-based sexual abuse), UK citizens perceived NCSII to have worse impacts on survivors than Norwegian citizens. Moreover, data trends suggested participants attributed increased victim-blame in vignettes featuring casual relationships, with higher self-reported psychopathic personality traits predicting judgements associated with viewing NCSII as less criminal in nature. 
Conclusion: These findings emphasise a need to better understand the role of legislation in public perceptions of NCSII (and image-based sexual abuse more broadly) and the need to be conscious about further exploring technology-facilitated crime internationally.",2025-03-27,"image-based sexual abuse,non-consensual sharing of intimate images,psychopathy,revenge pornography,victim blame",,,"Anny C.

E01F5-022-85A,"Celebrity status, sex, and variation in psychopathy predicts judgements of and proclivity to generate and distribute deepfake pornography","With the advent of means to generate and disseminate fake, sexualised images of others for the purposes of financial gain, harassment, or sexual gratification, there is a need to assess and understand the public’s awareness and judgements of said behaviour. In two independently-sampled studies, we used moderation (Study 1) and linear mixed effects (Study 2) analyses to investigate whether judgements of deepfaking differed as a function of victim status (celebrity, non-celebrity), victim and participant demographics, and image use (sharing, own sexual gratification), whilst controlling for the potential covariates of psychopathy and beliefs about a just world. We consistently observed more lenient judgements of deepfake generation and dissemination for victims who were celebrities and male, and when images were created for self-sexual gratification rather than being shared. Moreover, lenient judgements, as well as proclivity to act were predicted by greater levels of psychopathy. We discuss our findings in the context of needing to qualitatively understand the general public’s rationale for said disparity in judgements, as well as identifying and combating barriers to disclose victimisation.

E008F-58D-4B7,Content Moderator Startle Response: A Qualitative Study,"Commercial Content Moderators review user-generated content (UGC) to ensure the posts meet platform policies, guidelines, community standards, and regional laws. While the majority of posted UGC is deemed acceptable, a large amount of content remains, which is classified as non-compliant and may include gore, violence, suicide, child sexual abuse material (CSAM), and pornography, to name a few. Because of this, content moderators have a greater prevalence of their nervous system activating a startle response, which can impact emotional, psychological, and physiological processes. Prior research on content moderators has failed to explore moderators' initial reactions to content from the start of employment through tenure as the subjection to material and habituation increases. This study takes an in-depth look at moderators' experiences from recruiting, through training, and production to better understand the content moderators' startle response and factors that enable startle habituation. The current study sample consisted of a total of 78 respondents - 38 content moderators located in the Philippines employed by TaskUs Inc. and 40 content moderators located in Estonia employed by Sutherland Global Services. Employee tenure ranged from 0-6 months. Succeeding our analysis, transparency, understanding, and preparedness were major themes identified as the critical factors found within both companies when exploring the activation of the startle response and facilitation of habituation following content exposure. These themes were prevalent in the recruiting, training, and production phases of the employment life-cycle.",2022-06-01T18:40:11.349917+00:00,"recruitment,startle habituation,startle response,wellbeing,resilience,commercial content moderation,training",,,"Rainer Mere, Priyanka Manchanda, Miriah E.

E001A-280-175,Examining the Gendered Impacts of Technology-Facilitated Sexual Violence: A Mixed Methods Approach,"This study employed a mixed methods approach, integrating quantitative online survey data (N = 333; Mage = 33.91; 63% women) with qualitative interview data (N = 10; Agerange = 24-46; 50% women) to gain a more comprehensive understanding of TFSV. We found that victims of TFSV experienced anxiety, stress, depression, loss of control, mistrust, multiple victimizations, poor academic/occupation functioning, problematic alcohol consumption, embarrassment, and online behaviour changes (e.g., limiting personal information online) due to TFSV victimization. Individuals who experienced online image-based abuse reported greater distress on items of depression, anxiety, and occupational/academic functioning than did victims of other types of TFSV. The current study provides partial support for the gender similarities hypothesis that TFSV is not exclusively a gender-based harm; our findings suggest that women and men’s TFSV experiences are similar for most TFSV types. Overall, the present study demonstrates the negative impact TFSV has for both women and men and highlights the need for greater awareness and increased support for all victims of this form of sexual violence.",2021-11-08T18:12:34.754104+00:00,"sexual harassment,mixed methods,sexual violence,gender,technology,internet abuse",,,"Amanda champion, Flora Oswald, Cory Pedersen, Devinder Khera",psyarxiv
E006A-6B7-D83,"Understanding social judgments of, and proclivities to commit upskirting","Against a backdrop of legislative change that sees the taking of private sexual images underneath the clothing of a non-consenting other being made a criminal offence – upskirting – there is a need to understand the public’s judgments of, and motivations to perpetrate said behavior. In this study (N = 490), we investigated whether judgments of upskirting differed as a function of victim sex (male, female) and their perceived attractiveness (attractive, unattractive), as well as how variation in voyeuristic interest, belief in a just world, and psychopathic personality traits predicted judgments of, and proclivity to engage in upskirting behaviors. We consistently observed more lenient judgments of upskirting behaviors when victims were attractive and male, with such judgements predicted by older age across all conditions. Moreover, proclivity to engage in upskirting was predicted by past voyeuristic behaviors, higher psychopathic personality, and being male and of older age. We discuss our findings in the context of needing to qualitatively understand the general public’s rationale for said disparity in judgments, as well as identifying and combating barriers to disclose victimization.

E0101-0D4-1EE,Delineating non-consensual sexual image offending: Towards an empirical approach,"The topic of non-consensual sexual images has become an increasingly important issue within the social policy landscape. Social and legal scholars have advocated for these behaviours to be designated sexual offences due to the mode of perpetration of these behaviours, but are explicit in their rejection of a sexual element being important in the motivations underpinning such behaviours. However, this rejection is inconsistent with the core theoretical models related to sexual offending. In this article, we outline some of the potential psychological concepts that may help us to understand how and why people engage in a range of non-consensual sexual image offences, such as revenge pornography, upskirting, deepfake media production, and cyber-flashing. In doing so, we aim to begin to bridge the gap between legal scholars and psychological scientists, and develop a more comprehensive and theoretically coherent approach to studying this important social topic.",2019-06-12T19:58:21.005041+00:00,"upskirting,courtship disorder,cyber-flashing,non-consensual sexual images,dick pics,sexual offending,deepfake,revenge pornography,exhibitionism,pornography",,,"Craig A.

E003B-D9B-A86,Understanding Image-Based Sexual Abuse through Greek Public and Legal Lenses: A Constructionist Thematic Analysis,"Image-Based Sexual Abuse (IBSA), including deepfake sexual abuse - where fake yet lifelike sexual content is generated of non-consenting persons - constitutes a growing form of digitally mediated gender-based violence that remains largely under-researched within non-Anglophonic contexts. This study explores how IBSA is constructed and perceived by both laypeople and lawyers in Greece, a Southern European setting characterised by economic precarity, traditional gender norms, and evolving yet challenging legal frameworks. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with 21 participants either originating from or living in Greece (n = 16 lay persons, n = 5 legal professionals), we employed constructionist thematic analysis to examine how participants discursively frame IBSA, its motivations, barriers to reporting, legal challenges, and preventative measures. Five themes were identified: (1) constructions of IBSA as gendered violence motivated by control, humiliation, and financial exploitation; (2) barriers to reporting shaped by shame, stigma, and widespread mistrust in police institutions; (3) legal barriers related to financial inaccessibility and fragmented, outdated legal frameworks; (4) the central role of informal support networks alongside calls for education and public awareness; and (5) deepfake technologies as an emergent form of economic exploitation, particularly impacting sex workers within a legal vacuum. The findings highlight the need for structurally informed, context-sensitive responses to IBSA that address the intersections of gender, law, technology, and economic vulnerability.",2025-07-03,,,,"Anastasia Rousaki, Dean Fido",psyarxiv
E0203-BD9-6A0,Development and validation of the Beliefs about Revenge Pornography Questionnaire,"Revenge pornography has become an increasingly prominent topic in social and legislative discussions about sexual crime, but has received relatively little attention within psychological research. Here, we leveraged existing theorizing in the area of sexual offending proclivity to systematically develop and validate of a measure of beliefs about revenge pornography. Using a large international community sample (N = 511) we found our ‘Beliefs about Revenge Pornography Questionnaire (BRPQ)’ to be comprised of three underpinning domains: ‘Victims as Responsible’, ‘Sociological Explanations’, and ‘Revenge Pornography as a Sexual Offense’. Concurrent validity is demonstrated through relationships with trait empathy, belief in a just world, dark personality traits, and rape myth acceptance. Randomly dividing the sample, we also show that the BRPQ predicts both revenge pornography proclivity (n = 227) and social judgements of this type of offending (n = 233). Implications and future directions are discussed.",2020-11-28T22:38:34.394099+00:00,"sexual abuse,images based sexual abuse,offense proclivity,scale development,forensic psychology,scale validation,social attitudes,revenge pornography",,,"Lorraine Smith, Dean Fido, Jessie Leach, Neil Daruwala, Craig A.

E00C0-653-6D6,What Do We Know About the Mental Health of Porn Performers? A Systematic Literature Review,"Purpose: Much has been debated about the impact pornography has on the health of those who consume it. But how is it affecting the people starring in it? Performing in porn is a unique profession which requires a person to have sex with other—often unfamiliar—people in front of a camera for a living, comes with various kinds of stigma, and is accompanied by several health risks for professionals and amateurs. This brief report compiles available evidence on the mental health of performers in porn. Design/methodology/approach: This paper employs the PRISMA approach to systematically review existing research from health sciences and psychology to provide an overview of what is known about mental health in porn performers. Findings: Only three US studies examine the topic and none of them are recent, which may be due to porn performers being a population which has been described as hard to reach for researchers. The existing knowledge on performers’ mental health is inconclusive at best, but points toward significantly poorer mental health and higher prevalence of mental disorders in some, but not others. New general research on the topic is needed to close this gap. More importantly, granular investigation into which populations are at risk of developing poor mental health and due to which circumstances is needed as a basis to support vulnerable performers. Originality: This is the first systematic review compiling existing evidence on mental health of porn performers. An approach to address this lack of research is proposed.",2022-01-24T15:27:09.406933+00:00,"porn actor,sex work,porn,porn performer,mental health,porn actress",,,Hannes Jarke,psyarxiv
E00FE-A4F-A03,Why Do You Watch This Rough Stuff? Understanding Women's Paradoxical Pornography Preferences,"Different sources show a notable interest among women in pornographic themes related to dominance and submission, including non-consensual sexual encounters. This phenomenon has been labeled a paradox. To research factors driving the use of such pornography, we adopted a comprehensive biopsychosocial approach. Our study involved an online sample of 571 women, designed to be demographically close to age and education levels in Germany. Participants were exposed to consensual or non-consensual literature-based pornographic stimuli, and their sexual arousal was assessed. Additionally, we examined various traits encompassing societal influences (rape myth acceptance, prior use of violent sexual pornography) and biological-evolutionary factors (sex drive, K-factor, onset of menarche). Our findings revealed significant main effects of rape myth acceptance and sex drive on sexual arousal in response to both stimuli. Prior consumption of violent sexual pornography demonstrated an interaction, suggesting potential desensitization to more conventional pornographic content. Traits associated with life history, such as the K-factor and the onset of menarche, did not influence sexual arousal. These results prompt a discussion within the context of proximate influences, such as socialization. Our interpretation does not support the notion of a minority engaging in fast life history strategies among women, as suggested in prior research.",2023-10-15T12:15:09.956232+00:00,"pornography preferences,female sexual behavior,non-consensual pornography",,,"Maximilian T.

E00F4-2A8-B2A,Exploring perceptual similarity and its relation to image-based spaces: an effect of familiarity,"One challenge in exploring the internal representation of faces is the lack of controlled stimuli transformations. Researchers are often limited to verbalizable transformations in the creation of a dataset. An alternative approach to verbalization for interpretability is finding image-based measures that allow us to quantify image transformations. In this study, we explore whether PCA could be used to create controlled transformations to a face by testing the effect of these transformations on human perceptual similarity and on computational differences in Gabor, Pixel and DNN spaces. We found that perceptual similarity and the three image-based spaces are linearly related, almost perfectly in the case of the DNN, with a correlation of 0.94. This provides a controlled way to alter the appearance of a face. In experiment 2, the effect of familiarity on the perception of multidimensional transformations was explored. Our findings show that there is a positive relationship between the number of components transformed and both the perceptual similarity and the same three image-based spaces used in experiment 1. Furthermore, we found that familiar faces are rated more similar overall than unfamiliar faces. That is, a change to a familiar face is perceived as making less difference than the exact same change to an unfamiliar face. The ability to quantify, and thus control, these transformations is a powerful tool in exploring the factors that mediate a change in perceived identity.",2021-05-21T23:05:01.820147+00:00,"pca,face recognition,similarity,perceptual space,image-based spaces,familiarity",,,"Rosyl Somai, Peter JB Hancock",psyarxiv
E00DE-3F4-A36,Gloss discrimination: Towards an image-based perceptual model,"Gloss is typically considered the perceptual counterpart of a surface’s specular reflectance characteristics, much as color is the perceptual counterpart of a surface’s diffuse reflectance spectrum. In many contexts, it is tempting to ask how discriminable two surfaces are on the basis of their reflectance properties. Yet, as we argue here, this is a poorly-posed question, as factors other than reflectance (e.g., lighting, shape, viewpoint) can have substantial effects on how discriminable two images of glossy surfaces are to human participants. This fundamental difficulty with predicting gloss discrimination, whether from a physical measurement or from proximal image data, has so far hobbled efforts to establish a rigorously defined perceptual standard for surface gloss, similar to those that exist for color. Here, we propose an experimental framework for making this problem tractable, starting from the premise that any perceptual standard of gloss discrimination must account for how distal scene variables influence the statistics of proximal image data. With this goal in mind, we rendered a large set of images in which shape, illumination, viewpoint, and surface roughness were varied. For each combination of viewing conditions, a fixed difference in surface roughness was used to create a pair of images showing the same object (from the same viewpoint and under the same lighting) with high and low gloss. Human participants (N=150) completed a paired comparisons task in which they were required to select image pairs with the largest apparent gloss difference. Importantly, rankings of the scenes derived from these judgments represent differences in perceived gloss independent of physical reflectance. We find that these rankings are remarkably consistent across participants, and are well predicted by a straightforward Visual Differences Predictor (Daly, 1992; Mantiuk et al., 2023). This allows us to estimate reasonable bounds on visual discriminability for a given surface across a wide range of viewing conditions. This has potential applications in both vision science, computer graphics and industrial contexts.",2024-07-07T19:16:38.837877+00:00,,,,"James Ferwerda, Jacob Raleigh Cheeseman, Roland Fleming, Takuma Morimoto",psyarxiv
E0075-5E5-87C,Neural Mechanisms of the Rejection-Aggression Link,"Social rejection is a painful event that often increases aggression. However, the neural mechanisms of this rejection-aggression link remain unclear. A potential clue may be that rejected people often recruit the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex’s (VLPFC) self-regulatory processes to manage the pain of rejection. Using functional MRI, we replicated previous links between rejection and activity in the brain’s mentalizing network, social pain network, and VLPFC. VLPFC recruitment during rejection was associated with greater activity in the brain’s reward network (i.e., the ventral striatum) when individuals were given an opportunity to retaliate. This retaliation-related striatal response was associated with greater levels of retaliatory aggression. Dispositionally aggressive individuals exhibited less functional connectivity between the ventral striatum and the right VLPFC during aggression. This connectivity exerted a suppressing effect on dispositionally aggressive individuals’ greater aggressive responses to rejection. These results help explain how the pain of rejection and reward of revenge motivate rejected people to behave aggressively.",2018-03-19T17:29:09.462697+00:00,"exclusion,revenge,fmri,reward,self-regulation,pain,vlpfc,taylor aggression paradigm,ventral striatum,brain,neuroimaging,frontostriatal,aggression,aggressive behavior,pleasure,retaliatory aggression,cyberball,neuroscience,retaliation,social rejection",,,"C.

E0239-DEE-4B3,The Role of Positive Affect in Aggression,"Aggressive behavior hurts us all and is studied across psychology’s sub-disciplines. Classical theories discuss the causes of aggression in the context of negative affect (e.g., frustration, pain). However, more recent research implicates positive affect as an important correlate and cause of aggression. Such aggressive pleasure likely evolved from ancient predatory tendencies that later yielded reproductive benefits, holds across reactive and proactive forms of aggression, and is used strategically as an item in many people’s emotion-regulation toolkit. Findings from psychological and neural sciences have converged to detail aggression's hedonically pleasant qualities and the motivational and biological mechanisms through which they occur. This new approach generates novel hypotheses and might lead to effective interventions that mollify mankind’s aggressive tendencies.",2017-08-09T17:45:01.087035+00:00,"reward,aggressive behavior,positive affect,motivation,violence,revenge,pleasure,aggression,violent behavior",,,David Chester,psyarxiv
E0084-2DD-95E,"Personality Correlates of Revenge-Seeking: Multidimensional Links to Physical Aggression, Impulsivity, and Aggressive Pleasure","People differ in how much they seek retribution for interpersonal insults, slights, rejections, and other antagonistic actions. Identifying individuals who are most prone towards such revenge-seeking is a theoretically-informative and potentially violence-reducing endeavor. However, we have yet to understand the extent to which revenge-seeking individuals exhibit specific features of aggressiveness, impulsivity, and what motivates their hunt for retribution. Toward this end, we conducted three studies (total N = 673), in which revenge-seeking was measured alongside these other constructs. Analyses repeatedly demonstrated that revenge-seeking was associated with greater physical (but not verbal) aggressiveness, anger, and hostility. Revenge-seeking’s link to physical aggression was partially accounted for by sadistic impulses toward enjoying aggression and the tendency to use aggression to improve mood. Dominance analyses revealed that such sadistic impulses explained the most variance in revenge-seeking. Revenge-seeking was associated with greater impulsive responses to negative and positive affect, as well as greater premeditation of behavior. These findings paint a picture of revenge-seekers as physically aggressive curators of anger, whose retributive acts are performed with planned malice and motivated by the act’s entertaining and therapeutic qualities.",2017-11-16T14:02:21.233084+00:00,"traits,vengeance-seeking,positive urgency,vengeance,anger,premeditation,sadism,negative affect,gender,positive affect,personality,dominance analyses,mood,aggression,impulsivity,big five,anger rumination,revenge,negative urgency",,,"David Chester, C.

E0005-052-25C,Some Revenge Now or More Revenge Later? Applying an Intertemporal Framework to Retaliatory Aggression,"Retaliatory aggression is a rewarding behavior. Decisions about rewarding behaviors often involve an intertemporal bias, such that people prefer immediate rewards and discount delayed rewards. We integrated these literatures to test whether the delay discounting framework could be applied to retaliatory aggression. Across six studies (total N = 1,508), participants repeatedly chose between immediate-but-lesser or delayed-but-greater retaliation. As with other rewards (e.g., money), participants preferred immediate-but-lesser retaliation, discounting the value of delayed-but-greater revenge. Rates of aggression discounting were temporally stable and associated with greater aggressive behavior. Experimentally-induced angry rumination reduced discounting rates, motivating participants to wait longer to inflict greater harm. Participants with greater antagonistic traits (e.g., physical sadism), displayed stronger preferences for delayed-but greater vengeance. These findings suggest that some dispositionally aggressive individuals may delay retaliation in service of greater future revenge. Our results bolster the important role of reward in retaliatory aggression and suggest that an intertemporal framework is likely a fruitful area of investigation for antisocial behavior. We discuss the implications of our findings in relation to contemporary theories of aggression and broader theories of antisocial behavior.",2021-07-30T19:28:06.415987+00:00,"itap,delay discounting,mcq,acq,retaliation,aggression,retaliatory aggression,impulsivity,revenge",,,"Nayaab Khan, David Chester, Samuel James West, Calvin Hall, Emily Lasko",psyarxiv
E014E-DB9-76F,The Satisfaction Is Mine: Extrinsic Reward Reduces Desire for Revenge,"Revenge is often driven by desire to feel gratified. Consequently, extrinsic reward should diminish revengeful cravings. One hundred fourteen participants received either insulting or praising feedback from another individual, were led to believe that they or the other individual won an unexpected monetary reward, and then indicated how much they desired revenge. Participants who received insulting feedback desired revenge more than praised counterparts, yet insulted participants who won the reward desired revenge less than those who did not win. This evidence emphasizes the need for personal satisfaction as fuel for revenge as well as highlights the importance of balancing the scales in retribution seeking.",2021-10-12T08:33:20.018078+00:00,"provocation,revenge,reward",,,"Blazej Mrozinski, Karolina Dyduch-Hazar",psyarxiv
E022B-030-244,Punishment Is Strongly Motivated by Revenge and Weakly Motivated by Inequity Aversion,"There are two broad functional explanations for second-party punishment: fitness-leveling and deterrence. The former suggests that people punish to reduce fitness differences, while the latter suggests that people punish in order to reciprocate losses and deter others from inflicting losses on them in the future. We explore the relative roles of these motivations using a pre-registered, two-player experiment with 2,426 US participants from Amazon Mechanical Turk. Participants played as the “responder” and were assigned to either a Take or Augment condition. In the Take condition, the “partner” could steal money from the responder’s bonus or do nothing. In the Augment condition, the partner could augment the responder’s bonus by giving them money at no cost to themselves or do nothing. We also manipulated the responders’ starting endowments, such that after the partner’s decision, responders experienced different payoff outcomes: advantageous inequity, equality, or varying degrees of disadvantageous inequity. Responders then decided whether to pay a cost to punish the partner. Punishment was clearly influenced by theft and was most frequent when theft resulted in disadvantageous inequity. However, people also punished in the absence of theft, particularly when confronted with disadvantageous inequity. While the effect of inequity on punishment was small, our results suggest that punishment is motivated by more than just the desire to reciprocate losses. These findings highlight the multiple motivations undergirding punishment and bear directly on functional explanations for the existence of punishment in human societies.",2020-06-15T21:18:31.685209+00:00,"fitness-leveing,deterrence,competition,revenge,punishment,inequity aversion",,,"Mark Bracic, Nichola Raihani, Paul Deutchman, Katherine McAuliffe",psyarxiv
E013A-045-245,Aggression As Successful Self-Control,"A dominant narrative is that aggression starts when self-control stops --- unchecked aggressive impulses manifest in violence as self-control fails to inhibit them. Yet this ‘low self-control syndrome’ approach to aggression fails to accommodate numerous findings in which aggression arises from successful self-control. I summarize these key findings while identifying how current theories of aggression can be molded to accommodate them. This balanced perspective, which allows aggression to arise from successful and unsuccessful self-control, suggests exciting new hypotheses alongside confounding questions for aggression and self-regulation scholars. It also supports ongoing and broader paradigm shifts away from treating self-control as a purely adaptive and desirable psychological capacity and toward approaching self-control interventions with greater care, as they may amplify aggression instead of reducing it, with costly consequences.",2023-02-16T03:32:13.855378+00:00,"violence,impulse control,self-control,revenge,aggression,aggressive behavior,self-regulation",,,David Chester,psyarxiv
E01D0-389-170,Political repression motivates antigovernment violence,"We examined whether political repression deters citizens from engaging in antigovernment behavior (its intended goal), or in fact motivates it. Analyses of 101 nationally representative samples from three continents (N = 139,266) revealed a positive association between perceived levels of repression and intentions to engage in antigovernment violence. Additional analyses of fine-grained data from three countries characterized by widespread repression and antigovernment violence (N = 2,960) identified a positive association between personal experience with repression and intentions to engage in antigovernment violence. Randomized experiments revealed that memories about repression also motivate participation in antigovernment violence. These results suggest that political repression, aside from being normatively abhorrent, motivates anti-repressor violence.",2020-05-10T16:11:36.219398+00:00,"political repression,political violence,revenge,state repression",,,"Henrikas Bartusevicius, Florian van Leeuwen, Michael Bang Petersen",psyarxiv
E0169-DC7-EB6,Perceptual judgements are resistant to the advisor's perceived level of trustworthiness: a deep fake approach,"As we navigate our environment, we often make spontaneous judgments about others. Trustworthiness is a key characteristic that we judge instantly and then use when making decisions, especially when we are uncertain. While the effect of trustworthiness on social behaviour has been extensively investigated, it remains unclear how trustworthiness affects more ‘basic’ cognitive processes such as perceptual decision-making. The present study aims to fill this gap. In the first experiment (N = 100), we validated a new trustworthiness manipulation by using deep fake technology to create animated versions of perceptually trustworthy, untrustworthy, and neutral static computer-generated faces. In the second experiment (N = 199), the deep fake procedure was applied to a new set of trustworthy and untrustworthy faces that served as advisors during a perceptual decision-making task. Here participants had to indicate the direction of dots that were either moving coherently to the left or to the right (i.e., random dot motion task). Contrary to our predictions, participants did not follow the advice of the trustworthy advisors more often than the advice of the untrustworthy advisors. We did find that participants decided faster and were more confident when following the advice, but this was also not influenced by the trustworthiness of the advisors. We integrate our findings within theoretical frameworks of advice taking, domain specificity of facial trustworthiness, and task requirements.",2024-05-09T12:35:09.876570+00:00,"deep fake,faces,social cognition,trustworthiness,advice taking,perceptual decision making",,,"Sam Verschooren, Marcel Brass, Mathias Van der Biest, Frederick Verbruggen",psyarxiv
E000C-921-4B0,Neglect: An Interpretative Phenomenological Investigation of Senior Care Professionals’ Experiences Working with Neglected Adolescents,"This study explores the phenomenon of neglect in adolescence as seen by senior care professionals. Five senior professionals took part in semi-structured interviews. We used an interpretative phenomenological approach to identify idiographic themes and superordinate themes that were common across participants. Reflexive bracketing and unbracketing were explicitly integrated into the interpretative processes. In our participants’ experiences, neglect extends as a spectrum; perpetuates itself as a cycle; and can be particularly difficult to detect in adolescence because of certain societal and professional factors. For our participants, neglect in adolescence is situated in a complex web of related factors including family stability, parental mental health and parenting attitudes. Given the common co-occurrence of the concepts of abuse and neglect in academic and professional literature, we sought to establish how our participants experienced neglect in relation to abuse. By incorporating a drawing task into our phenomenological interviews, we obtained revealing visual metaphors of this relationship between neglect and abuse. Future research implications are discussed.",2019-01-08T14:32:55.815030+00:00,"phenomenology,neglect,abuse,ipa,adolescence,neglected adolescents,care professionals",,,"Felicity L Bishop, Ehab W.

E017C-052-63F,When home is where the harm is: Family betrayal and posttraumatic outcomes in young adulthood,"Research on institutional betrayal has found that institutional wrongdoing that fails to prevent or respond supportively to victims of abuse adds to the burden of trauma. In this two-study investigation with young adult university students, we demonstrated parallels between institutional betrayal and ways that families can fail to prevent or respond supportively to child abuse perpetrated by a trusted other, a phenomenon we call family betrayal (FB). In Study 1, psychometric analysis of a new FB questionnaire provided evidence of its internal consistency, unidimensionality, and convergent and discriminant validity. The majority (approximately 72%) of young adults abused in childhood reported a history of FB, with an average of 4.26 FB events (SD = 4.45, range 0-14). Consistent with betrayal trauma theory, Study 2 revealed that FB was 4x more likely to occur in relation to childhood abuse by someone very close to the victim (vs. non-interpersonal victimization), with a particularly strong effect for female participants. FB history predicted significant delay to disclosure of a self-identified worst traumatic event (ηp2 = .017) and significant increases in dissociation (∆R2 = .05) and posttraumatic stress (∆R2 = .07) symptoms in young adulthood. Moreover, with FB in the regression models, only FB—not child abuse nor recent interpersonal victimization—predicted dissociation and clinically significant elevations in posttraumatic stress. Findings suggest that FB is a prevalent phenomenon among young adults abused as children and that it explains unique, clinically significant variance in posttraumatic distress, warranting increased attention from trauma researchers and clinicians.",2019-05-17T02:37:40.461084+00:00,"family,abuse,dissociation,childhood trauma,trauma,child abuse,betrayal trauma,disclosure,interpersonal violence,posttraumatic stress,family betrayal",,,"Marina Rosenthal, Brianna Delker, Rosemary E.

E021B-6DD-42E,Severe Sexual Abuse Reduces Frontoparietal Network Activity during Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Updates,"Trauma and trauma-related disorders are characterized by altered learning styles. Two learning processes that have been delineated using computational modeling are model-free and model-based reinforcement learning (RL), characterized by trial and error and goal-driven, rule-based learning, respectively. Prior research suggests that model-free RL is disrupted among individuals with a history of assaultive trauma and may contribute to altered fear responding. Currently, it is unclear whether model-based RL, which involves building abstract and nuanced representations of stimulus-outcome relationships to prospectively predict action-related outcomes, is also impaired among individuals who have experienced trauma. The present study sought to test the hypothesis of impaired model-based RL among adolescent females exposed to assaultive trauma. Participants (n=60) completed a three-arm bandit RL task during fMRI acquisition. Two computational models compared the degree to which each participant’s task behavior fit the use of a model-free versus model-based RL strategy. Overall, a greater portion of participants’ behavior was better captured by the model-based than model-free RL model. Although assaultive trauma did not predict learning strategy use, greater sexual abuse severity predicted less use of model-based compared to model-free RL. Additionally, severe sexual abuse predicted less left frontoparietal network encoding of model-based RL updates, which was not accounted for by PTSD. Given the significant impact that sexual trauma has on mental health and other aspects of functioning, it is plausible that altered model-based RL is an important route through which clinical impairment emerges.",2019-10-18T00:08:47.456651+00:00,"computational modeling,model-based reinforcement learning,computational psychiatry,abuse,trauma,assault,latent states",,,"Allison M.

E002F-0BF-C73,Severe Childhood Trauma Differentially Impacts Emotion Recognition in Males and Females with First-Episode Psychosis,"Background: Childhood trauma increases social functioning deficits, which in turn, negatively impact social inclusion in those experiencing first-episode psychosis (FEP). Associations between aberrant higher-order social cognitive processes such as emotion recognition (ER) and trauma severity may be one pathway by which trauma negatively impacts social functioning. Given sex differences identified in the experience of childhood trauma, it is pertinent to evaluate how trauma severity may differentially impact ER in males and females. Method: Eighty-three FEP participants (52 males, 31 females) and 69 nonclinical controls (49 males, 20 females) completed the CogState Research Battery. FEP participants completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. A sex × group (FEP, controls) ANOVA examined ER differences and was followed by two-way ANCOVAs investigating the effects of sex and childhood trauma severity (none, low, moderate, severe) on ER and global cognition in FEP. Results: FEP participants had significantly lower ER scores than controls (p = .035). In FEP, a significant interaction emerged between sex and childhood trauma severity (F(3, 72) = 6.382, p = .001), selective to ER, while controlling for age at onset. Simple effects analyses revealed that females in the severe trauma category exhibited superior ER capacity relative to males. Conclusions: The differential impact of trauma severity on ER in males and females with FEP may be theoretically interpreted as the distinct way that hypervigilance affects the sexes. Early intervention services should refine social cognitive interventions in male and female trauma survivors to facilitate social functioning improvements.",2020-10-13T18:58:49.496758+00:00,"childhood trauma,trauma,psychosis,neglect,fep,sex differences,emotion recognition,social cognition,abuse,first-episode psychosis",,,"Ashok K.

There are a few different types of abuse: psychological, physical, etc., and each of these different types has its own unique effects on a child. However, sometimes patterns can be observed which can link a serial killer’s patterns to his/her victim pool and modus operandi. The paper will observe two female serial killers up close and examine the psychological motives behind their heinous crimes and how their childhoods can be linked to their M.O. and victim pool.

This study aimed to explore the nature and frequency of animal-related calls received by UK domestic abuse helpline staff during the COVID-19 pandemic, examine any lockdown-related changes, identify potential commonalities across helpline organisations, and explore perspectives about ongoing animal-related issues in the context of domestic abuse. Semi-structured virtual interviews were conducted with 11 domestic abuse helpline staff workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were subjected to thematic analysis. The analysis revealed four overarching themes. Theme 1) Lockdown-related changes in the frequency and nature of animal-related calls received. Theme 2) Animals as tools for abuse during lockdown, with subthemes a) Manipulating the family-animal bond, and b) Fears over animal safety. Theme 3) Animals as barriers to refuge during lockdown, with subthemes, a) Lack of animal-friendly accommodation, b) Lack of social support systems, and c) Animals as coping mechanisms. Theme 4) Helpline staffs’ awareness of and links to animal friendly accommodation and fostering services.

E018F-DA7-3CA,Sequelae of Child Maltreatment: Umbrella synthesis on mental health correlates in over 11 million participants,"Numerous meta-analyses have established associations between child maltreatment and mental health. However, variation exists between reviews regarding the magnitude of these predictions. A systematic, quantitative umbrella synthesis (i.e. meta-analysis of meta-analyses) was undertaken to describe the associations between various types of maltreatment (i.e. physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, neglect, prenatal substance misuse, adverse childhood experiences and intimate partner violence) and mental health issues including executive functioning. We analysed and combined effect sizes from 97 quantitative meta-analyses comprising more than 11 million participants, published between January 1, 2016, and July 19, 2021. Child maltreatment was associated with all examined outcomes: 1) externalizing problems (r = 0.21), 2) internalizing problems (r = 0.21), 3) thought problems (r = 0.33), 4) executive functioning (r = 0.23), 5) suicide and related behaviors (r = 0.24), 6) substance misuse (r = 0.20), 7) interpersonal violence (r = 0.25) and 8) other psychological difficulties (r = 0.22). Findings demonstrate that maltreatment is associated with various psychological difficulties, and these associations tend to be of similar magnitude for different forms of maltreatment. A parsimonious explanation for these findings would be a common mechanism(s) or a general psychopathology factor conferring high risk for different mental health problems following child maltreatment. For practitioners and service providers, these results indicate a comparable degree of mental health difficulties across all forms measured in the wake of maltreatment. The results call into question the conventional wisdom that suggests some forms of maltreatment are intrinsically more harmful to mental health than others.",2022-12-19T09:08:02.669969+00:00,"child development,meta=analysis,psychiatric disorder,abuse,child harm,neglect",,,"Helen Beckwith, Alfred Markham, Lianne Bakkum, Marian Bakermans-Kranenburg, Robbie Duschinsky, Barry Coughlan, Guy Skinner, Marinus H. van IJzendoorn",psyarxiv
E0147-931-41D,Population-based estimates of associations between child maltreatment type: A meta-analysis,"Context: There is growing interest in better understanding the specificity and magnitude of associations between child maltreatment types in the general population. Objective: To investigate patterns of covariation between child maltreatment types by meta-analyzing studies that assessed experiences of maltreatment using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) in population-representative samples. Data Sources: A systematic review of studies available on PubMed, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar was conducted. The bibliographies of studies identified were assessed using forward and backward searching. Study Selection: Included studies used the CTQ, a population-representative sample, and had available data to calculate effect sizes. Data Extraction: Data were converted from pearson correlations to Z statitics, and pooled using a random-effects model. Results: All maltreatment types were positively and significantly associated with one another. Effect size estimates varied from medium to large effects, with (1) physical abuse and emotional abuse (Z = 0.72, 95% CI [.48, .96]); (2) physical neglect and emotional neglect (Z = 0.62, 95% CI [0.43, 0.81]); and (3) emotional abuse and emotional neglect (Z = 0.54, 95% CI [0.35, 0.72]) demonstrating the strongest associations. Limitations: Limitations include the relatively few number of studies included, exclusion of other types of adversity, and those associated with the CTQ—a retrospective, self-report measure that does not account for the concurrence of experiences. Conclusions: These analyses provide important evidence of the associations between types of child maltreatment. The pattern of associations indicate the likelihood of shared risk and point to potential characteristics that may link different types of maltreatment.",2020-07-24T14:50:33.740859+00:00,"abuse,co-occurrence,early adversity,neglect,child maltreatment",,,"Kathryn Humphreys, Hannah Piersiak, Mia Letterie, Maya Matsumoto",psyarxiv
E0209-698-1F0,"Intimate Partner Violence in Premarital Relationships in Iran: Prevalence, Associated Factors and Predictors of Violence among Educated Iranian Women","Introduction: Intimate partner violence is a widespread global issue, affecting millions of women and causing physical, mental, and social problems. Factors contributing to this violence include socio-cultural and evolutionary factors. In Iran, as the country transitions to a more egalitarian society, new partnerships and premarital relationships which still haven't been accepted by the society and law, face challenges. This study aims to examine the prevalence, socioeconomic factors, and predictors of intimate partner violence among Iranian female university students to inform interventions and address this urgent problem. Methods: We applied Composite Abuse Scale to 318 female medical residents, students, and other healthcare-related majors. Results: We observed 11%, 17.3%, 9.4%, 6.6%, and 11% of the participants experienced total abuse, emotional abuse, physical abuse, harassment, and severe combined abuse respectively. Intimate partner violence was associated with family salary, physical and psychiatric symptoms, substance use, suicide, and a family history of suicide. And physical and psychiatric issues, substance use, suicide, and family history of suicide predicted abuse experiences. Conclusion: Our study highlights a significant prevalence of partner violence among educated women, calling for more research and preventive measures in healthcare settings. Creating a safe environment, implementing preventive strategies, efficient interventions, involving both genders, and improving the management system are crucial for addressing and reducing violence against women.",2023-07-04T03:25:19.232177+00:00,"interpersonal relationship,partner abuse,iranian women's rights,intimate partner violence,abuse,violence,women's rights,partner violence",,,"Mehrdad Eftekhar Ardebili, Nazila Jabbarinejad, Roxana Jabbarinejad, Morteza Naserbakht",psyarxiv
E024E-DDE-F87,Role of Homoeopathy in Withdrawal Symptoms of Addictive Substance Abuse in Modern Society,"Environment, genetics, and mental illness are just some common causes of addiction in our society. Addiction is often unintentional, and can even happen when someone accidentally misuses prescription drugs. Alcohol is the most commonly abused substance followed by Nicotine, Cannabis, opiates or opiod drugs. Substance abuse and addiction have grave consequences on our existing social systems, effecting crime rates, hospitalizations, child abuse, and child neglect, and are rapidly consuming limited public funds. The intravenous drug abuser represents the fastest growing vector of HIV virus. Addiction is most commonly caused by physical and psychological changes that occur in the body and brain on behalf of drug and alcohol abuse. In today’s age of stress, a fast lifestyle, blatant media consumption and instant gratification, picking up habits like alcoholism and smoking is very easy. However, the addictive nature of these substances is strong, and it is fairly common to become dependent. The difference between substance abuse and addiction is very slight. Substance abuse means using an illegal substance or using a legal substance in the wrong way. Addiction begins as abuse, or using a substance like marijuana or cocaine.

E0036-EC6-38A,Adverse Childhood Experiences and All-Cause Mortality Risk in Adulthood,"Background: Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) have been associated with mortality risk in adulthood. It is unclear, however, whether ACEs perpetrated beyond parents may be associated with mortality risk, if the risk is accumulative or plateaus at a certain frequency, whether associations differ dependent on ACE types, whether types interact with one another, or if observed effects differ by sex. Objective: To examine associations between ACEs and mortality risk. Participants and Setting: 6319 participants (age range 25-74 years, mean [SD] 46.91 [12.95] years; 51.6% female) followed from 1995/96 to 2018 as part of the survey of Midlife Development in the United States. Methods: ACE variables were self-reported exposure to 20 ACE types from five categories: physical abuse, emotional abuse, socioeconomic disadvantage, adverse family structure, and poor health at age 16 years. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate mortality risk. Results: ACEs were accumulatively associated with increased mortality risk in adjusted models (HR = 1.033; p = &lt;.001, 95% CI, 1.014-1.053). The association was linear. Only physical abuse (HR = 1.05; p = .024, 95% CI, 1.01 – 1.10) remained significantly predictive of increased mortality risk adjusting for other types. No interaction by sex or among ACE types was observed. Conclusions: ACEs may be cumulatively associated with increased mortality risk, such that each individual ACE increases risk. Physical abuse may be an important ACE type within a mortality risk context. Individual ACE types warrant further study as each type may have their own differential impact on mortality risk.",2023-04-18T07:56:29.750357+00:00,"adulthood,abuse,neglect,mortality risk,adverse childhood experiences,maltreatment",,,"Angelina Sutin, Nicholas A.

This chapter addresses one of the most societally pervasive consequences of child maltreatment which is known as the “cycle of victimization”. This concept depicts the increased risk of maltreated individuals to victimize others later in life, both within and outside the family environment. To understand the architecture of this victimization cycle, the chapter further sheds light on neurocognitive mechanisms aiding different forms of victimization and the buffering role of social support that could help break the cycle of victimization. Advancing our understanding of these complex and interrelated mechanisms will ultimately facilitate the design and implementation of more targeted early treatments and (preventive) interventions and support a move towards a safer society.",2021-05-24T19:32:34.226823+00:00,"neglect,abuse,protective factors,intergenerational transmission,child maltreatment,social support,violence,victimization",,,"Samantha Vermeulen, Lenneke Alink, Maximilian Scheuplein, Anne-Laura Van Harmelen",psyarxiv
E0068-187-F57,A Historical Review of Gaslighting: Tracing Changing Conceptualizations Within Psychiatry and Psychology,"Gaslighting is a form of psychological manipulation that causes a victim to doubt their sense of reality, usually leading to a loss of agency (i.e., confidence and sense of self) and emotional and mental instability. The phenomenon was first identified over 50 years ago and discourse on the topic was largely confined to psychiatry/medicine; however, interest in gaslighting has experienced a resurgence with expansion both in terms of the contexts in which gaslighting is thought to occur as well as disciplines weighing in on the topic. Indeed, Merriam-Webster chose ‘gaslighting’ as its word of the year in 2022. The aim of this article is to offer a historical review of work on gaslighting that tracks how the term has evolved and to identify core features of the phenomena. In doing so we identify points of consensus and tension in the literature. We conclude by making specific recommendations for the future of scholarship on gaslighting.",2023-08-23T20:57:49.644448+00:00,"gaslighting,close relationships,history of psychology,abuse",,,"Jennifer Bartz, Suzanne Wood, Willis Klein",psyarxiv
E0018-463-851,“It's not a physical prison but you can't get out”. How autistic adults make sense of the experience of intimate violence and abuse,"Background: Autistic people are more likely to experience intimate partner violence (IPV) than non-autistic peers, but our knowledge about how they recognise abuse and make sense of what has happened to them is sparse. The aim of this study was to explore how autistic people recognise and make meaning after experiencing IPV. Method: We recruited 21 autistic adults to take part in a semi-structured interview about the experience of IPV. We asked questions about how they had made sense of their experiences, and how it had impacted them. We analysed the data using reflexive thematic analysis. One author coded all data, engaging in reflexive discussion with the whole team. They organised codes into themes in collaboration with a second team member. Results: We identified three themes in the data, which focussed on understanding and sense-making after intimate violence. Theme 1) 'Power' focussed on the role that power dynamics had played in sense-making. Theme 2 'Disruptions of self' explored feeling of dehumanisation, objectification and stigmatisation among participants that led to them feeling like they were worth less than others, and that they had to mould themselves to fit perpetrator expectations. Theme 3 'Now, with hindsight' focussed on how survivors had struggled to recognise the violence, with a sense that it could 'always be worse', and that they needed clearer understanding of what 'red flags' look like in a relationship. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that making sense of the experience of intimate violence among autistic adults is shaped by both individual, interpersonal, and societal factors which normalise violence against autistic people, making it difficult to leave abusive relationships. By highlighting the factors that shape understanding, we can explore how to prevent these occurrences in future (e.g. better early education about neurodiversity, and relationships).",2024-04-10T07:24:54.009163+00:00,"coercive control,intimate partner violence,autism,abuse",,,"Felicity Sedgewick, Kieran Rose, Alex Mitchell, Amy Pearson, Wendy Joseph, Sarah Douglas, Monique Botha",psyarxiv
E0059-8DD-C96,"“It's a long process, and it's a long journey”: Autistic adult’s experiences of support and recovery after experiencing intimate violence and abuse","Background: Many services designed to support victim/survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV) do not have a specific focus on, or understanding of neurodivergence, which may impact autistic access to meaningful support. The aim of this project was to examine the support and recovery needs of autistic adults who have experienced IPV. Method: We recruited 21 autistic adults (mean age = 42) to take part in a semi-structured interview about the experience of IPV. We asked questions about their support seeking, and recommendations for future intervention. We analysed the data using reflexive thematic analysis. One author coded all data, engaging in reflexive discussion with the whole team. They then organised these into themes in collaboration with a second team member. These were circulated to the whole team for discussion and refinement. Results: We identified three themes in the data, which focused on support and recovery: 1) Recovery is a journey (recovery is non-linear, and involves multiple disclosures over time). 2) Building better systems (addressing systemic gaps in knowledge and practice, combatting under-resourcing), and 3) How do we stop this? (recognising potential individual risk factors and increasing relationship education). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that approaches to supporting autistic victim/survivors in recovery needs a nuanced, multi-pronged approach. Intervention should focus on relationship education ensuring access to appropriate therapies and support for individuals and ameliorating systemic issues such as a lack of professional understanding, and lack of practical support for survivors",2024-04-10T07:28:15.034492+00:00,"autism,abuse,intimate partner violence,coercive control",,,"Kieran Rose, Amy Pearson, Sarah Douglas, Felicity Sedgewick, Wendy Joseph, Monique Botha, Alex Mitchell",psyarxiv
E00CB-568-6D5,Maltreatment impairs executive functioning in childhood and adolescence – a multilevel meta-analysis,"Child maltreatment (CM) represents a key risk factor for a wide range of maladaptive developmental outcomes. In particular, child abuse and neglect are thought to exert detrimental effects on neurocognitive development, including impairments in executive functions (EF) during childhood. We conducted a preregistered multilevel meta-analysis to examine differential associations between CM dimensions and core EF domains: working memory, inhibitory control, and cognitive flexibility. Based on 59 studies with 13,022 participants, our results indicate a medium-sized association (g = 0.43) between overall CM and EF, although high levels of heterogeneity were observed both within and between studies. While differential outcomes as a function of EF domains may partly explain this heterogeneity, maltreatment dimensions (i.e., abuse vs. neglect) did not account for it. These findings suggest a non-specific association between CM dimensions and EF domains, potentially driven by shared attachment-related characteristics of CM.",2024-12-06T16:43:12.037453+00:00,"executive functions,child development,cognitive flexibility,abuse,meta-analysis,child maltreatment,working memory,neglect,inhibitory control",,,"Anastasiia Perevoznikova, Lars White, Philipp Berger, Charlotte Grosse Wiesmann, Jan Keil",psyarxiv
E001D-0F1-A4B,"Acute subjective effects of psychedelics in naturalistic group settings prospectively predict longitudinal improvements in trauma symptoms, trait shame, and connectedness among adults with childhood maltreatment histories","Studies of psychedelic use in naturalistic and clinical settings have suggested safety and mental health benefits for adults with histories of childhood maltreatment. Acute psychological mechanisms that predict therapeutic benefits in this population, however, have yet to be determined. Two common group settings of naturalistic psychedelic use – organized ceremonies and raves or other electronic dance music events – might facilitate therapeutic psychedelic effects because of the unique psychosocial environments they comprise. This prospective, longitudinal study sought to investigate 2 primary questions: first, whether adults with maltreatment histories planning to use psychedelic drugs with therapeutic intent at ceremonies or raves would see enduring psychological benefits after their experiences; and second, whether subjective dimensions of the acute psychedelic experience would be associated with post-acute psychological benefits. Eighty-five participants completed self-report measures in the month before, within 2 days after, and approximately 2 months after a planned psychedelic experience with therapeutic intent at a ceremony or rave assessing childhood maltreatment history; trauma symptoms, internalized (trait) shame, and connectedness at baseline and follow-up; and various dimensions of the acute subjective psychedelic experience. Mean scores in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, complex PTSD symptoms, trait shame, social connectedness, and general connectedness significantly improved from baseline to 2-month follow-up (d = 0.73-1.12). Longitudinal changes in outcomes significantly correlated with acute subjective effects of the psychedelic experience. These findings have implications regarding both the potential clinical benefit of psychedelic use among adults with childhood maltreatment histories as well as the psychological mechanisms of therapeutic action of psychedelics.",2024-07-26T22:53:37.750003+00:00,"rave,lsd,festival,cptsd,psychological mechanisms,complex trauma,psilocybin,trauma,ptsd,connectedness,psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy,complex ptsd,adverse childhood experiences,mdma,naturalistic,maltreatment,ceremony,neglect,shame,electronic dance music,ayahuasca,abuse,psychedelics",,,"Jeremy Varon, Wendy D'Andrea, CJ Healy, Anna Sanford, Albert Garcia-Romeu, Stephen Kirsch, Aaron Frazier, McWelling Todman",psyarxiv
E01A2-25E-B25,"Investigating relationships between genetic risk, childhood maltreatment and eating disorders","Importance: The associations between eating disorder polygenic scores and eating disorders are
unclear. Furthermore, while both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the
development of eating disorders, their interplay is poorly understood.

Objective: This study extends prior research by examining whether childhood maltreatment and
polygenic scores for anorexia nervosa and binge-eating are associated with eating disorders. We
also examine the interactions between childhood maltreatment and eating disorder genetic
liability in predicting eating disorders.

Design, Setting and Participants: This nested-case control study examined associations in up to
63,989 mothers recruited from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa).
Data were analysed from August 2023 to March 2025.

Exposures: We indexed genetic liability to eating disorders using polygenic scores for anorexia
nervosa and binge-eating. Four types of childhood maltreatment were assessed: long-term
humiliation or degradation, threats to self or close others, physical abuse, and sexual abuse
Main outcomes and Measures: Diagnoses of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating
disorder, purging disorder, and binge-eating spectrum disorders were ascertained using self-
report data from five timepoints and population health registers.

Results: The prevalence of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, purging
disorder, and binge-eating spectrum disorders was 2.19%, 4.15%, 10.39%, 0.60%, and 12.96%,
respectively. Frequency of childhood maltreatment ranged from 4.25% (threatened) to 12.03%
(degradation/humiliation). All forms of childhood maltreatment were strongly associated with
elevated likelihood of eating disorders (odds ratios, ORs, ranged from 1.71 to 3.29), as were
eating disorder polygenic scores (ORs ranged from 1.05 to 1.31). There were no multiplicative
interaction effects between childhood maltreatment and polygenic scores. Small additive
interactions were observed between polygenic scores for anorexia nervosa and binge-eating
broad and degradation/humiliation for bulimia nervosa and binge-eating spectrum disorders in
exploratory analyses.

Conclusions and Relevance: Our findings demonstrate that both eating disorder polygenic
scores and childhood maltreatment are associated with higher odds of various eating disorders.
Furthermore, our findings provide tentative evidence of small interaction effects between
polygenic liability and childhood maltreatment in predicting eating disorders, suggesting that
their combined influence further elevates the risk of some eating disorders.",2025-03-17,"MoBa,abuse,childhood maltreatment,eating disorder risk,gene-environment interaction,genetic risk,polygenic risk",,,"Johanne Hagen Pettersen, Laura Hegemann, Ludvig Daae Bjørndal, Alexandra Havdahl, Eivind Ystrom, Helga Ask, Ole A.

E0184-7C1-F65,A theoretical framework for studying the phenomenon of gaslighting,"Gaslighting is a form of psychological manipulation that, over time, causes a victim to doubt their sense of reality, often leading to a loss of agency and emotional and mental instability. Currently mechanistic explanations for gaslighting are rooted in unfalsifiable psychodynamic theory. We propose a theoretical framework that draws upon prediction error minimization, symbolic interactionism, attachment theory, self-verification theory, and shared reality theory to illustrate the cognitive mechanisms that allow gaslighting to occur. We hypothesize that gaslighting depends on normative social-cognitive mechanisms operating in atypical social situations. Our model assumes that (close) relationships fulfill important epistemic needs—close others shape and verify our self-views and our experience of the world. This privileged position of close others is what gives gaslighters the epistemic leverage required for gaslighting to be effective. We then apply our theoretical framework to the cycle of gaslighting and conclude by distinguishing gaslighting from other related phenomena.",2025-05-08,"Gaslighting,abuse,close relationships,epistemic trust,prediction error minimization,shared reality,social baseline theory",,,"Jennifer Bartz, Willis Klein, Suzanne Wood",psyarxiv
E0071-DDA-89C,Seeing is Believing: The Continued Influence of a Known AI-Generated 'Deepfake' Video,"Advances in artificial intelligence mean it is becoming easier to create highly realistic deepfake videos, which can appear to show someone doing or saying something they did not in fact do or say. Deepfakes may present a threat to individuals and society: for example, deepfakes could be used to influence elections by discrediting political opponents. Psychological research suggests that people cannot reliably identify deepfakes and thus can be influenced by their content. However, little is yet known about the potential impact of a deepfake video which has been explicitly identified and flagged as fake. We explored this issue with two preregistered studies in which participants were shown a bespoke deepfake video of a man appearing to admit to committing a crime. Participants were then asked questions about the man’s guilt, to test how they had been influenced by the video’s content. We found that most participants relied on the content of a deepfake video, even when they had been explicitly warned beforehand that it was fake. This result was observed even with participants who indicated that they believed the warning and knew the video to be fake. We also found this specific warning to be no more effective than a generic warning about the existence of deepfake videos. Our findings suggest that identifying and flagging deepfake videos will not entirely negate their influence. This has implications for legislators, policy makers, and regulators of social media platforms and online news.",2024-05-23T11:27:21.719145+00:00,"artificial intelligence,deepfake,misinformation,social media,psychology",,,"Simon Clark, Stephan Lewandowsky",psyarxiv

However, the consequences of pornography are a much-debated issue and research is inconclusive in this respect whether it causes problems like attention deficit, decreased memory, less integration, low self-esteem or heightened sense of gratification, increase in sexual knowledge, sexual satisfaction, and academic performance. The least research has been done to advance PA treatment because American Psychological Association’s unclear stand on pornography. However, some researchers suggested different therapies, but all those therapies are criticized as methodologically flawed, with fewer sample sizes and sample homogeneity.

Using videos from the Deepfake Detection Challenge, we investigated DDP in two unique observer groups: Super-Recognizers (SRs) and ""normal"" officers from within the 18K members of the Berlin Police. SRs were identified either via previously proposed lab-based procedures or the only existing tool for SR identification involving increasingly challenging, authentic forensic material: the Berlin Test For Super-Recognizer Identification (beSure®). Participants judged either pairs of videos, or single videos in a 2-alternative forced-choice decision setting (i.e., which of the pair, or whether a single video was a deepfake or not). We explored speed-accuracy trade-offs, compared DDP between lab-identified SRs and non-SRs, and police officers as a function of their independently measured face identity processing (FIP) ability. Interestingly, we found no relationship between DDP and FIP ability. Further work using static deepfakes created with current state-of-the-art generative models is needed to determine the value of SR deployment for deepfake detection in law enforcement.",2024-01-13T20:21:39.496175+00:00,"law enforcement,policing,super-recognizers,deepfake detection,facial identity processing",,,"Matthew J Vowels, Matthew Groh, Meike Ramon",psyarxiv

E00E5-A00-48F,Investigating relationships between moral foundations and support for revenge,"Revenge is a complex phenomenon that has long attracted attention from scholars across
disciplines. In two pre-registered studies, we applied insights from moral foundations theory to
examine how moral values are associated with attitudes toward revenge. In Study 1 (N = 299),
endorsement of the binding foundations (loyalty, authority, and purity) was positively associated
with support for revenge, whereas endorsement of the individualizing foundations (harm and
fairness) was negatively associated. Study 2 (N = 852), which focused on a specific case of
sexual assault, revealed a more nuanced pattern: individualizing values were linked to justifying
the victim’s revenge and attributing responsibility to the perpetrator, while binding values were
linked to blaming the victim for engaging in revenge. Together, these findings demonstrate a
novel application of moral foundations theory to the study of retribution, offering new insight
into the moral correlates of when, and for whom, revenge is viewed as legitimate.",2025-09-29,"Binding Values,Individualizing Values,Moral Foundations,Revenge,Victim Blaming",,,"Zhaoquan Wang, Liane Young, Stylianos Syropoulos, Kyle Fiore Law",psyarxiv
E014D-8CB-36E,Facial Expression is Retained in Deep Networks Trained for Face Identification,"Facial expressions distort visual cues for identification in two-dimensional images. Face processing systems in the brain must decouple image-based information from multiple sources to operate in the social world. Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) trained for face identification retain identity-irrelevant, image-based information (e.g., viewpoint). We asked whether a DCNN trained for identity also retains expression information that generalizes over viewpoint change. DCNN representations were generated for a controlled dataset containing images of 70 actors posing 7 facial expressions (happy, sad, angry, surprised, fearful, disgusted, neutral), from 5 viewpoints (frontal, 90-degree and 45-degree left and right profiles). Two-dimensional visualizations of the DCNN representations revealed hierarchical groupings by identity, followed by viewpoint, and then by facial expression. Linear discriminant analysis of full-dimensional representations predicted expressions accurately (72% correct for happiness, followed by surprise, disgust, anger, neutral, sad, and fearful at 39%; chance = 14.29%). Expression classification was stable across viewpoints. Representational similarity heatmaps indicated that image similarities within identities varied more by viewpoint than by expression. We conclude that an identity-trained, deep network retains shape-deformable information about expression and viewpoint, along with identity, in a unified form—consistent with a recent hypothesis for ventral visual stream processing.",2020-05-19T16:52:44.997543+00:00,"linear discriminant analysis,deep network,emotion,object recognition,neural network,karolinska,facial expression,computer vision,face recognition,t-sne,expression",,,"ALICE O'TOOLE, Y.

E00C9-744-B93,Deepfaked online content is highly effective in manipulating people’s attitudes and intentions,"In recent times, disinformation has spread rapidly through social media and news sites, biasing our (moral) judgements of other people and groups. “Deepfakes”, a new type of AI-generated media, represent a powerful new tool for spreading disinformation online. Although Deepfaked images, videos, and audio may appear genuine, they are actually hyper-realistic fabrications that enable one to digitally control what another person says or does. Given the recent emergence of this technology, we set out to examine the psychological impact of Deepfaked online content on viewers. Across seven preregistered studies (N = 2558) we exposed participants to either genuine or Deepfaked content, and then measured its impact on their explicit (self-reported) and implicit (unintentional) attitudes as well as behavioral intentions. Results indicated that Deepfaked videos and audio have a strong psychological impact on the viewer, and are just as effective in biasing their attitudes and intentions as genuine content. Many people are unaware that Deepfaking is possible; find it difficult to detect when they are being exposed to it; and most importantly, neither awareness nor detection serves to protect people from its influence.

I then use an integrable nonautonomous Lotka-Volterra model to study the interactions among these searches in three U.S. States (Mississippi, Nevada and Utah), the District of Columbia and in the U.S. as a whole. I find that the results are very similar in all areas analyzed, and for different specifications of the model. Prior to the pandemic outbreak the interactions among health worry, economic worry and news consumption are very weak. However, from around the beginning of the pandemic these interactions intensify greatly, and unemployment predates searches for news and for symptoms. Conversely, news and symptoms proceed in mutualism.

Childhood emotional abuse has been linked with mental and physical health concerns yet may be perceived as less severe than other forms of childhood abuse. The present study aims to (1) understand perceptions of childhood abuse forms across psychologists, general college-level students, and the general public; and (2) investigate whether personal emotional abuse history affects perceptions of emotional abuse. Method. Participants (N = 444) completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire–Short Form and provided perceived abuse severity and offender responsibility on eight case vignettes of emotional, physical, sexual, and no abuse. Research Question 1 was tested with a two-way (vignette type × participant type) multivariate analysis of variance performed on perceived severity and offender responsibility scores. Research Question 2 included abuse history as a third factor to examine potential moderation. Results. All three groups perceived scenarios regarding emotional abuse as less severe and the offender less responsible than scenarios regarding sexual or physical abuse. Unexpectedly, psychologists were just as variable in their perceptions of abuse severity across abuse forms, as compared to the general public and college students. However, psychologists with emotional abuse histories provided more severe ratings on emotional abuse items, more in line with general public perceptions. College students’ and the general public’s relative ratings were roughly equivalent regardless of emotional abuse history. Conclusions. The study calls for more attention to emotional abuse in psychologist training programs.

The present study examined how deepfake quality, media literacy, and attitudes toward the person depicted in the video shape individuals’ ability to detect political deepfakes, their emotional responses (liking), and behavioral intentions (social media sharing). A total of 1,124 participants from the United Kingdom, Slovenia, and Italy viewed manipulated videos about climate change and immigration that varied in quality. The results showed that high-quality deepfakes were less likely to be detected and received more positive evaluations than low-quality ones. In contrast, quality did not significantly influence sharing intention. Media literacy and attitudes toward the person in the video emerged as strong predictors across outcomes; higher media literacy improved detection and reduced liking and sharing, while more positive attitudes decreased detection and increased both liking and sharing. Mediation analyses demonstrated that liking partially mediated the link between detection and sharing intention. Furthermore, moderated mediation models revealed that this indirect effect was stronger among individuals with high media literacy (for climate change videos) and favorable attitudes toward the video’s subject (for both topics). Overall, the study highlights the need for interventions that address not only detection skills but also emotional and motivational susceptibility to persuasive synthetic media.

E0164-77F-86D,Mindfulness-based relapse prevention trial for compulsive sexual behaviour disorder,"Background and aims: Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder (CSBD) is a medical condition that can impair social and occupational functioning and lead to severe distress. To date, treatment effectiveness studies of CSBD are under-developed; typically, treatment for CSBD is based on guidelines for substance or other behavioural addictions. Mindfulness-based relapse prevention (MBRP) is an evidence-based treatment for substance addiction aimed at, among other things, reducing craving and negative affect—i.e. processes that are implicated in the maintenance of problematic sexual behaviours. However, to our knowledge no prior research has been published evaluating mindfulness-based intervention in the treatment of CSBD, except two clinical case reports. Therefore, the aim of the current preliminary research was to examine whether MBRP can lead to clinical improvement in CSBD. Methods: Participants were 13 adult males with a diagnosis of CSBD. Before and after the eight-week MBRP intervention, participants completed a booklet of questionnaires including measurements of porn viewing, masturbation and emotional distress. Results: As expected, we found that after MBRP participants spent significantly less time engaging in problematic pornography use and exhibited a decrease in anxiety, depression and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Discussion and Conclusions: The findings indicate that MBRP could be beneficial for CSBD individuals. Further clinical effectiveness studies with bigger sample sizes, delayed post-training measurements and randomised control trial design are warranted. In conclusion, MBRP leads to a decrease in time spent watching porn and a decrease in emotional distress in CSBD patients.",2020-03-23T23:32:24.192212+00:00,"csbd,addiction,mindfulness-based relapse prevention,mbrp,porn addiction,mindfulness",,,"Pawel Holas, Karol Lewczuk, Małgorzata Draps, Ewelina Kowalewska, Mateusz Gola",psyarxiv
E001C-1FF-3E1,Labeling Synthetic Content: User Perceptions of Warning Label Designs for AI-generated Content on Social Media,"In this research, we explored the efficacy of various warning label designs for AI-generated content on social media platforms—e.g., deepfakes. We devised and assessed ten distinct label design samples that varied across the dimensions of sentiment, color/iconography, positioning, and level of detail. Our experimental study involved 911 participants randomly assigned to these ten label designs and a control group evaluating social media content. We explored their perceptions relating to 1) Belief in the content being AI-generated, 2) Trust in the labels and 3) Social Media engagement perceptions of the content. The results demonstrate that the presence of labels had a significant effect on the user’s belief that the content is AI-generated, deepfake, or edited by AI. However their trust in the label significantly varied based on the label design. Notably, having labels did not significantly change their engagement behaviors, such as ’like’, comment, and sharing. However, there were significant differences in engagement based on content type: political and entertainment. This investigation contributes to the field of human-computer interaction by defining a design space for label implementation and providing empirical support for the strategic use of labels to mitigate the risks associated with synthetically generated media.",2025-02-20T11:57:42.989521+00:00,"warning labels,content labels,#ai content,deepfake images,deepfakes",,,"Arosha Bandara, Dilki, Dilrukshi Gamage, Min Zhang",psyarxiv

Both methods yielded comparable associations of 2D:4D with a range of sexually differentiated personality measures, including the Big Five, aggression, hypermasculinity, and self-esteem (partly additionally assessed with implicit tasks and peer-ratings complementing the self-report measures). Directly ascertained 2D:4D was significantly less precisely measurable and significantly higher than 2D:4D ascertained from images by the same observers. In particular, measurement method impacted fingers differentially: directly measured index vs ring fingers were 1% vs 2% shorter, thereby yielding higher 2D:4D than when measured from images. Finger differences in fingertip size have been hypothesized to account for such discrepancies. However, fingertip size is unrelated to 2D:4D. Alternatively, diminished finger extensibility in supinated hand position (when taking direct measurements), as compared with finger extensibility in pronated hand position (when taking palmar-view hand images), might account for these observations. For anatomical reasons, this effect should be stronger for ring fingers than for index fingers and moreover should increase with age.

Of the unfounded suspicions, 14.5% and 9.1%, for adolescents and adults, respectively, had been reported to the authorities. The prevalence of CSA seems to decrease while more and more allegations reach the authorities.

The analysis identified experiences which had a high influence on other symptoms within the network, centered around showing, being shown and touching and having to touch other persons genitals. Clique percolation was performed to identify abuse type clusters with the results supporting a distinction in contact and non-contact abuse with the former involving physical abuse and the latter focusing mostly on verbal suggestions and witnessing of sexual acts. Types of abuse that may act as bridges between the abuse type clusters were identified with threats of complicity in sexual acts and watching someone else showing off their genitalia being the potential behavioural bridges between the abuse type clusters.

E010F-4BB-14A,The association between parental substance abuse and child maltreatment – a systematic review,"Background: Prior research suggests that parental substance abuse is associated with a reduction in the ability of parents to monitor and care for their children and provide safe and nurturing homes. This systematic review addresses the link between parental alcohol and drug abuse and different forms of child maltreatment across studies.
Methods: Three databases were searched to identify peer-reviewed, English language studies from 1991 to 2023. A total of 35 studies met inclusion criteria. Prevalence of each type of childhood maltreatment, parental substance abuse, sample characteristics, and methodological factors were considered for each eligible study.
Results: Among parents with substance abuse problems, the estimated prevalence of neglect was 48.7% (k = 8), of physical abuse 36.1% (k = 21), of sexual abuse 10.2% (k = 12), psychological abuse 28.5% (k = 6), and of out of out-of-home placements 34.0% (k = 9). The majority of studies recorded alcohol abuse (k = 21), opioids/heroin (k = 9), marijuana (k = 8), meth-/amphetamines (k = 7), and cocaine (k = 4). History of parental substance abuse, recruitment methods, and methods of assessing childhood maltreatment were associated with substantial heterogeneity. The majority of reviewed studies indicate a positive association between parental substance abuse and child maltreatment, especially with regard to neglect and physical abuse.
Conclusions: These findings support the need for adequate assessments and interventions of maltreated children, and treatment of substance abuse in parents. We discuss the importance of improved interdisciplinary collaboration and service integration between child welfare, substance abuse treatment, and family courts.",2025-04-11,"child maltreatment,child protection,child welfare system,legal psychology,out of home placement,parental substance abuse",,,"Jelena Zumbach-Basu, Laura Schall, Aleya Flechsenhar",psyarxiv

However, there remain questions about the relationship between prior interpersonal trauma, particularly that of neglect and abuse, and transdiagnostic dimensions such as intolerance of uncertainty (IU: the tendency to find uncertainty aversive). To address this gap, we conducted a secondary analysis of survey data from an international multi-site sample (n=2510). Questionnaires included: Interpersonal trauma by type (e.g. emotional neglect, physical abuse, psychological abuse, sexual abuse) and IU. The findings revealed that emotional neglect, compared to other types of abuse, was specifically related to higher IU. Furthermore, experiencing multiple forms of neglect and abuse was associated with higher IU. Importantly, these effects remained when controlling for broader negative beliefs about the self and others, and demographic factors (site, age, sex assigned at birth, and educational attainment). Overall, these findings demonstrate that interpersonal trauma, particularly emotional neglect, is associated with IU.

E015A-0D6-7CB,Addiction or Transgression? Moral Incongruence and Self-Reported Problematic Pornography Use in a Nationally Representative Sample,"pornography use may qualify for the new diagnosis of Compulsive Sexual Behavior Disorder (CSBD) in the forthcoming ICD-11. There is also evidence, however, that moral incongruence (i.e., a misalignment of moral beliefs about sexual behavior and actual sexual behavior) may inflate self-reports of problems associated with pornography use. Prior work suggests religiousness may drive such moral incongruence. Using a large sample matched to U.S. representative norms (Total: N=2,519; past-year pornography users: N=1,424, 66.4% men), the present work examined the interaction between pornography use and religiousness in predicting self-reported addiction to pornography. Results indicated that religiousness moderated the association between pornography use and self-reported addiction so that, despite a negative association between religiousness and use, at higher levels of religiousness, pornography use was more strongly related to self-reports of addiction.",2020-06-10T18:44:18.683945+00:00,"compulsive sexual behavior,hypersexual behavior,hypersexuality,porn addiction,sexual compulsivity,pornography,sex addiction",,,"Brinna N.

E0174-8E7-983,Profiles of Childhood Psychological Abuse and Neglect among Chinese College Students and Their Problematic Online Behaviors,"Background: Studies have shown that multiple forms of abuse may co-occur, resulting in specific abuse typologies. However, there is little understanding of complex interrelations of the different psychological abuse subgroups and internet game addiction and cyber-bullying. Objective: The objective of this study was to identify latent profiles of childhood psychological abuse and neglect among Chinese college students. Further, this study sought to examine the demographic characteristics of these profiles and the correlations between the profiles and problematic internet behaviors. Methods: Latent profile analysis was undertaken to examine patterns among abuse and neglect characteristics. One-way multivariate analysis of variance was used to examine the differences among profiles across six dimensions of psychological abuse and neglect. Multinomial logistic regression was then used to further examine how these profiles differed in demographic characteristics. Finally, Wald chi-square test was used to examine differences across profiles on online aggressive behavior and online gaming addiction. Results: Five latent profiles were identified: (1) Low Abuse and Neglect, (2) More Bark Than Bite, (3) Moderate Abuse and Neglect, (4) Traditional High Abuse and Neglect, and (5) High Abuse and Neglect. These profiles varied significantly across assessed domains of demographic characteristics, internet game addiction and cyber-bullying. Results indicated differential needs for effective interventions to address childhood psychological abuse and neglect. Conclusions: College students' online game addiction and online bullying behavior were closely related to childhood psychological abuse and neglect. In addition to problematic online behaviors, we conclude with discussion of the demographic characteristics of different potential categories. These findings have both practical and empirical significance for understanding and classifying experiences of psychological abuse and neglect.",2020-07-30T07:19:14.876418+00:00,"psychological abuse,internet game addiction,latent profile analysis,psychological neglect,cyber-bullying",,,"Mingfan Liu, Hohjin Im, Nannan Fan, Baojuan Ye, Qiang Yang, Xinqiang Wang",psyarxiv
E01BC-DB6-E6C,Conspiracy Believers Underuse Social Information (Like Everyone Else),"Conspiracy believers often claim to be critical thinkers doing their “own research” instead of relying on others’ testimony. In two preregistered behavioral studies conducted in the UK and Pakistan (Nparticipants = 864, Ntrials = 5408) we test if conspiracy believers have a general tendency to discount social information (in favor of their own opinions and intuitions). We found that conspiracy mentality is not associated with social information use in text-based (Study 1) and image-based (Study 2) advice-taking tasks. Yet, we found discrepancies between self-reported and actual social information use. Conspiracy believers were more likely to report relying less on social information than actually relying less on social information in the behavioral tasks. Our results suggest that the skepticism of conspiracy believers towards epistemic authorities is unlikely to be the manifestation of a generalized distrustful mindset. Conspiracy believers may be more permeable to social influence than they sometimes claim.",2022-09-26T11:43:01.416504+00:00,"conformity,egocentric discounting,epistemic individualism,conspiracy mentality,advice taking,social information",,,"Céline Schöpfer, Sacha Altay, Frédéric Tomas, Waqas Ejaz, Kenzo Nera",psyarxiv
E015D-263-C4E,Fit-for-Purpose Creativity Assessment: Automatic scoring of the Test of Creative Thinking - Drawing Production (TCT-DP),"Creativity is now universally recognized as an essential, 21st century competency. However, there are many practical barriers to the development of creativity in schools, universities and workplaces. Chief among these is a problem of the fitness-for-purpose of creativity assessments. Highly valid and reliable creativity tests, necessary to support the development of individual creativity, are typically slow and labor-intensive to administer and score. However, recent advances in machine learning are opening up solutions to the fitness-for-purpose problem, across a range of different modes (e.g., verbal and figural) of testing. This paper describes the development of a large, image-based, multi-label classification model capable of automatically scoring the figural Test of Creative Thinking – Drawing Production (TCT-DP) with accuracies comparable to those of typical human raters. The growth of this, and similar machine learning models, promises to transform the development of creativity in education, offering rapid, accurate and cost-effective assessments that can be seamlessly integrated into teaching and learning.",2023-09-07T02:09:36.181443+00:00,"classification,machine learning,artificial intelligence,creativity,assessment,fitness for purpose",,,"David H Cropley, Sven Mathijssen, Rebecca L Marrone, Caroline Theurer",psyarxiv
E00EB-526-F47,Psychological predictors of bystander reactions to the abuse of animals and humans,"While bystander reactions to violence against humans have been well studied, less is known about how people react to animal abuse. We studied whether the same psychological predictors are relevant to reactions to the abuse of animals and humans. We examined the role of Dark Tetrad traits (Narcissism, psychopathy, Machiavellianism, and sadism), ideologies of superiority (social dominance orientation and speciesism – the belief in human superiority over non-human animals), as well as moral disengagement, self-efficacy, and descriptive social norms in predicting reactions to animal and child abuse. In a survey study (N = 518), participants indicated their general reactions to animal abuse as well as how they would react in a situation depicting the abuse of a dog and a child.  The general reactions to animal abuse were best predicted by the Dark traits and the endorsement of the ideologies of superiority, most significantly, sadism and speciesism. Both animal and child abuse elicited high and comparable levels of distress and active response intentions. In addition to the general predictors mentioned above, bystander reactions in the case of animal abuse were predicted by lower moral disengagement and perceived self-efficacy, while it was moral disengagement alone that predicted reactions to child abuse. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the relevant psychological aspects of reactions to violence and empowering citizens to react more actively to abuse and violence.",2025-09-26,"Dark Tetrad,animal abuse,moral disengagement,speciesism",,,"Marija Branković, Anastasija Budžak",psyarxiv
E0007-0E7-BF3,Child Abuse Subtypes and Automatic Emotion Regulation Processes in Children and Adolescents,"Child abuse is associated with elevated risk for psychopathology. The current study examined the role of automatic emotion regulation as a potential mechanism linking child abuse with internalizing psychopathology. A sample of 237 youth aged 8–16 years and their caregivers participated. Child abuse severity was assessed by self-report questionnaires, and automatic emotion regulation was assessed using an emotional Stroop task designed to measure adaptation to emotional conflict. A similar task without emotional stimuli was also administered to evaluate whether abuse was uniquely associated with emotion regulation, but not cognitive control applied in a non-emotional context. Internalizing psychopathology was assessed concurrently and at a two-year longitudinal follow-up. Child abuse severity was associated with lower emotional conflict adaptation but was unrelated to cognitive control. Specifically, the severity of emotional and physical abuse, but not sexual abuse, were associated with lower emotional conflict adaptation. Emotional conflict adaptation was not associated with internalizing psychopathology prospectively. These findings suggest that childhood emotional and physical abuse, in particular, may influence automatic forms of emotion regulation. Future work exploring the socioemotional consequences of altered automatic emotion regulation among youth exposed to child abuse is clearly needed.",2021-02-12,,,,"David G. Weissman, Katie A.

E0251-4BD-CE1,Child physical abuse risk factors: A systematic review and a meta-analysis,"Child physical abuse (CPA) is a pervasive societal problem with serious outcomes. Understanding CPA risk factors is necessary to identify those at risk for CPA perpetration and to inform efforts to prevent the occurrence of CPA. The present study provides an updated review of conceptual models of CPA, a review of model-related CPA risk factors, and a meta-analytic review of CPA risk factors found in cross-sectional, case-controlled studies. The review of conceptual models yielded &gt;70 explanatory models of CPA from which &gt;140 putative CPA risk factors were extracted. A three-level random-effects meta-analysis of CPA risk factors was conducted. Database and literature searches yielded 58 studies that met the inclusion criteria from which 300 effect size (ES) estimates were identified. In the meta-analysis, 292 ESs were placed into 38 CPA risk factor domains. Twenty significant individual CPA risk factor domain ES estimates and five significant relationship CPA risk factor domain ESs were found. Future studies that simultaneously consider CPA risk and protective factors from within and between ecological levels and that establish causal CPA factors are needed to better inform CPA prevention and treatment efforts.",2022-11-21T23:14:20.447919+00:00,"systematic review,child physical abuse,risk factors,physical child abuse,perpetrators,child maltreatment,maltreatment,protective factors,child abuse,physical abuse,meta-analysis,child abuse risk factors",,,"Rodrigo Dominguez-Martinez, Joel S.

E0207-0BA-BE5,Mandated Child Abuse Reporting in a Multicultural Environment,"The abuse and neglect of children has been linked to their cognitive, academic, psychological, and behavioral demise. As a result of the deleterious effects that abuse can have on children’s development and well-being, all 50 states, including the District of Columbia, have enacted child abuse reporting laws for mental health professionals. These laws typically require a mandated child abuse report when child maltreatment has been reasonably suspected. Although mandated child abuse reporting laws appear straight-forward, mandated reporting often entails complex and nuanced decision-making, particularly when a child is from a diverse cultural background. Thus, this article offers a discussion for mental health professionals (e.g., psychologists, psychiatrists, counselors, social workers) regarding mandated child abuse reporting within a multicultural environment.",2022-01-08T16:04:32.404623+00:00,"child abuse and neglect,child abuse reporting,multicultural awareness,mandated child abuse reporting,child maltreatment",,,"Amanda Clinton, Karen L.

E0176-BA2-8C3,Predicting self-harm in survivors and perpetrators of domestic abuse,"Objective: Despite legislative developments within the UK seeking to reduce domestic abuse, not only are reports of domestic abuse increasing, but both survivors and perpetrators of domestic abuse engage in self-harming behavior and suicide attempts. Some of whom ultimately die by suicide. As such, identifying those at risk of self-harm within this population is paramount. Method: This study presents an analysis of a secondary dataset of 836 adults who presented at a UK-based domestic abuse charity between 2017 and 2022. The dataset was derived through a knowledge exchange partnership and featured both survivors and perpetrators of domestic abuse. Results: Though the logistic regression model was more proficient at predicting those more likely to not engage in self-harm, than those more likely to engage in self-harm, self-harm was predicted by witnessing domestic abuse as a child, reporting aggressive behavior, and previously or currently abusing alcohol, with the presence of aggressive behavior being the strongest predictor. Opposing existing literature, neither abusing drugs nor (not) having children contributed significantly to this model. Conclusions: Though results of this study require replication and extension, they indicate a series of variables which might serve as internationally relevant key indicators of risk for self-harm in survivors and perpetrators of domestic abuse. Charities which serve this population might seek to develop further educational material and interventions to rapidly deliver to service users who indicate risk during initial and subsequent consultations.",2023-03-14T16:02:34.373250+00:00,"substance abuse,domestic abuse,aggressive behavior,self-harm",,,"Joanna Adhikari, Louise Wallace, Dean Fido",psyarxiv
E019C-B1C-E2E,"Misogyny, Violent Extremism and Interpersonal Violence: Examining the Mediating and Contingent Effects of Revenge Motivation, Hypermasculinity, Collective Narcissism and Group Threats","The growing evidence base of risk factors for violent extremism demonstrates overlaps with parallel problem areas like domestic violence, mass murder, and stalking. Yet, empirical research examining the overlap among these domains is limited. The present analysis aims to address the lack of empirical research on the relationship between misogyny, violent extremism, and interpersonal violence by conducting survey-based analyses employing a newly developed and validated psychometric scale to measure misogyny. Based on a UK nationally representative survey (n = 1500), we examine the underlying mechanisms and contingent effects linking misogyny to violent extremism and interpersonal violence. We investigate how misogyny, frustrated narcissistic entitlement, and group threats among men translate into revenge motivation and hypermasculinity and thus, may increase violent extremist intentions and attitudes, as well as justification of and willingness to engage in interpersonal violence. The results show that misogyny predicts violent extremist attitudes and intentions as well as increased support for and willingness to engage in interpersonal violence via revenge planning and hypermasculinity, particularly among men who experience frustrated narcissistic entitlement and greater threats to the ingroup. Among women, misogyny is not associated with violent extremist attitudes or intentions but is associated with increased support for and readiness to use violence. Our findings have important practical implications as we provide evidence which articulates when and for whom misogyny may be a risk factor for violent extremism and interpersonal violence. Establishing the relevance of misogyny as a risk factor for (extremist) violence may provide evidence for more targeted prevention and intervention programs.",2021-08-13T17:20:18.984355+00:00,"collective narcissism,hypermasculinity,group threats,misogyny,violent extremism,terrorism,revenge motivation",,,"Caitlin Clemmow, Bettina Rottweiler, Paul Gill",psyarxiv
E0195-3B0-A49,Applying Socio-Emotional Information Processing Theory to Explain Child Abuse Risk: Emerging Patterns from the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic has exerted profound effects on parents, which may translate into elevated child abuse risk. Prior literature demonstrates that Social Information Processing theory is a useful framework for understanding the cognitive processes that can contribute to parental abuse risk, but the model has not adequately integrated affective processes that may coincide with such cognitions. Given that parents are experiencing intense emotions during the pandemic, the current study sought to examine how socio-emotional processes might account for abuse risk during the pandemic (perceived pandemic-related increases in harsh parenting, reported physical and psychological aggression, and child abuse potential). A sample of 304 mothers participated in an online study, reporting on their abuse risk as well as a number of socio-emotional processes. Greater approval of physical discipline and weaker anger regulation abilities were directly or indirectly related to measures of abuse risk during the pandemic, with maternal justification to use parent-child aggression to ensure obedience consistently relating to all indicators of abuse risk during the pandemic. Socio-emotional processes that include anger appear particularly relevant during the heightened period of strain induced by the pandemic. By studying multiple factors simultaneously, the current findings can inform child abuse prevention efforts.",2021-09-07T16:24:41.589813+00:00,"emotion,coronavirus,social information processing theory,physical child abuse risk,child abuse potential",,,"Christina Rodriguez, Kaitlin P.

As an example, we analyzed previous fMRI studies focusing on working memory extracted from NeuroSynth. The result from our Bayesian method showed a greater overlap than the classical method. In addition, Bayes Factors proved a better way to examine whether the evidence supported hypotheses than p-values.

This systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO registration number CRD42020197833) explored the associations between childhood emotional abuse and neglect and various adulthood mental health problems based on eight databases. There were 79 English and 11 Chinese studies meeting inclusion criteria. The results suggested that childhood emotional abuse and emotional neglect had positive associations with various adulthood mental health problems (d = 0.02-1.84) such as depression, anxiety, substance abuse, suicide ideation, or suicide ideation or attempts, personality disorder, eating disorder and other psychological symptoms in the general population and across different geographical regions. Further, the findings suggested that compared with individuals in non-clinical populations, individuals in clinical populations were more likely to have experienced emotional abuse and neglect during their childhood.

E00C1-501-BC0,Approval of Parent-Child Aggression as a Mediator of Intergenerational Child Abuse Risk: An Evaluation of Racial Differences,"Objective: Personal history of child abuse and parent-child aggression (PCA) can predict future parenting behavior, but some effects may differ between cultural groups. Black parents in the U.S. are more likely to encounter discrimination and to personally experience and approve of PCA use. This study examined whether personal abuse history predicted later parental child abuse risk, as mediated by PCA approval across the transition to parenthood, and whether effects differed by race. Method: Expectant parents (181 non-Hispanic White, 179 Black) participated in a prospective longitudinal study, assessed in the last trimester of pregnancy and when children were age 6 mo., 18 mo., and four years. History of PCA was assessed prenatally; an analog measure of child abuse risk and a self-report of PCA approval were administered at each timepoint, with parents reporting their PCA use at the last two timepoints. Results: Personal PCA history predicted greater PCA approval for Black parents, but this association was inconsistent for White parents. Greater PCA approval related to abuse risk for both groups. Personal PCA history did not significantly predict abuse risk for White parents, whereas Black parents’ personal PCA history more directly linked to their abuse risk—a link that differed significantly between groups. Conclusions: Findings suggest PCA approval can perpetuate the cycle of PCA but future work needs to consider differential effects by race and identify other factors that may explain direct effects of personal history on abuse risk. Development of abuse preventions should be more intentionally culturally informed to enhance efficacy.",2022-10-05T19:11:13.771714+00:00,"cycle of violence,intergenerational transmission of violence,psychological child abuse,child abuse risk,physical child abuse,parenting,racial disparities",,,"Doris F.

E021F-3BF-A07,Objecting to consensual experiments even while approving of nonconsensual imposition of the policies they contain,"In previous survey studies using decision-making vignettes in which respondents rated and ranked the appropriateness of universally implementing one intervention for all relevant people (A), universally implementing another intervention (B), or conducting an experiment (or A/B test) to compare these interventions before implementing the superior one, we have found that people are often averse to the A/B test, even when they approve of implementing either of the interventions the experiment contains (Meyer et al., 2019, Heck et al., 2020). However, these vignettes did not say explicitly whether or not consent to the A/B test—or to universal imposition of either A or B, untested—would be obtained. In a preregistered analysis, when we asked respondents in four of our previous survey experiments to explain their ratings, 18% of those who rated the A/B test commented negatively on the apparent lack of consent, compared to fewer than 1% of participants who rated the A or B conditions offering the same objection (Meyer et al., 2019). Because implementing A and implementing B, collectively, entail imposing the same risks on people as conducting an A/B test, this contrast is puzzling. Moreover, pragmatic trials of the sort our vignettes describe are often not feasible to conduct with consent; as a result, IRBs often waive the default requirement of consent and ethicists have also argued that consent to research is not always required. Here, in three studies using previous materials, we test the effect on experiment aversion (Heck et al., 2020; cf. Mislavsky et al., 2019) and the A/B effect (Meyer et al., 2019) of stipulating that consent to the A/B test either will or will not be obtained. In both vignettes we test, we find that negative sentiments towards experiments persist even when it is explicitly stated that consent will be obtained. While these negative sentiments are substantially reduced when consent is present (compared to when consent is absent or not mentioned), significant experiment aversion and A/B effects remain: 29–31% of participants were averse to the experiment and 32–39% ranked it as the worst decision the agent could make—even when consent would be obtained from everyone involved in the A/B test and from no one involved in either policy imposition.",2023-03-31T21:08:31.681810+00:00,"informed consent,pragmatic trial,field experiment,research ethics,experiment,trial,rct,a/b effect,consent,experiment aversion",,,"Randi L.

This underrepresentation in research is a barrier in understanding the negative outcomes associated with sexual abuse in men. Aims We aim to estimate the prevalence of sexual abuse in male MI patients, both for recent (past year) and lifetime abuse. Methods In order to model the prevalences and heterogeneity arising from reports, we use Bayesian random-effects estimation, along with additional meta-regression analyses to investigate differences in results arising from the design choices used by individual studies. We estimate separate prevalences for mixed-diagnosis samples, substance abuse samples and samples reporting specifically on intimate partner violence in MI patients. Results Victimisation rates were estimated to be high across all samples. Lifetime victimisation for mixed-diagnosis samples was estimated at 21%, for substance abuse samples 13%, and for mixed-diagnosis samples reporting on intimate partner violence at 5%. Past year victimisation for mixed-diagnosis samples was 4%. Considerable heterogeneity was present across all study groups, particularly so for the substance abuse sample. Discussion Sexual abuse prevalence in MI samples was found to be much higher than for men in the general population (1-7%).

E0192-5D5-B65,Outrage Fatigue? Cognitive Costs and Decisions to Blame,"Across nine studies (N=1,672), we assessed the link between cognitive costs and the choice to express outrage by blaming. We developed the Blame Selection Task, a binary free-choice paradigm that examines the propensity to blame transgressors (versus an alternative choice)—either before or after reading vignettes and viewing images of moral transgressions. We hypothesized that participants’ choice to blame wrongdoers would negatively relate to how cognitively inefficacious, effortful, and aversive blaming feels (compared to the alternative choice). With vignettes, participants approached blaming and reported that blaming felt more efficacious. With images, participants avoided blaming and reported that blaming felt more inefficacious, effortful, and aversive. Blame choice was greater for vignette-based transgressions than image-based transgressions. Blame choice was positively related to moral personality constructs, blame-related social-norms, and perceived efficacy of blaming, and inversely related to perceived effort and aversiveness of blaming. The BST is a valid behavioral index of blame propensity, and choosing to blame is linked to its cognitive costs.",2021-11-30T07:23:43.161744+00:00,"blame,effort,moral outrage,choice,efficacy",,,"Daryl Cameron, Veerpal Bambrah, Michael Inzlicht",psyarxiv
E0136-C57-BCB,The visual information available in virtual reality,"Perception in virtual reality is often compared to the perception of pictures. There are, however, important differences. A virtual reality environment, unlike a picture, is interactive and immersive. These properties give rise to novel theoretical challenges. Building on James J. Gibson's analysis of the perception of depictions, we raise three questions about perception in virtual reality, to which we offer tentative answers: 1) Is virtual reality a kind of picture perception? Answer: No. A virtual reality headset is better understood not as an image-based display but as a pair of electronic spectacles that allow the wearer to sample a simulated ambient optic array. 2) Who creates the information in virtual reality? Answer: The information is a joint creation of hardware developers, software engineers, and the observer. The observer is a co-creator of the information that they detect. 3) Are there affordances in virtual reality?

E0025-7C6-D68,Multimodal prior knowledge determines false memory formation,"Memory formation is a complex phenomenon shaped by various experiential traces, yet their exact contributions remain unclear. This study investigates the generation of false memories leveraging different data-driven computational models to independently quantify language-based and vision-based experiential knowledge, as extracted from large-scale databases consisting of 639 billion words and 15 million images, respectively. We then tested the effects of these knowledge sources in two false-memory experiments, one employing images and the other words as stimuli. Our findings unveil both modality-independent and modality-dependent processes in the formation of memory traces. Indeed, we observed a contribution of both prior visual and linguistic knowledge regardless of the types of stimuli to be memorised. However, the extent of this contribution differed as a function of the modality tested: visual prior knowledge is more influential in image-based tasks, while linguistic prior knowledge dominates in word-based tasks. This dual and modality-dependent contribution underscores the adaptive nature of memory processes, revealing the dynamic integration of diverse experiential traces in false memory formation.",2025-08-28,"Deese-Roediger-McDermott,False Memory Generator,False memories,language-based similarity,multimodal prior knowledge,vector-based models,vision-based similarity",,,"Daniele Gatti, Marco Marelli, Luca Rinaldi, Francesca Rodio, Marco Alessandro Petilli",psyarxiv
E01DD-770-81D,Enhancing Human Detection of Real and AI-Generated Hyperrealistic Faces,"Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have prompted concerns about the proliferation of deepfake content—synthetic images, audio, and videos—online. StyleGan2, a powerful generative adversarial network architecture, can generate synthetic images of human faces that appear more realistic than actual human faces—a phenomenon termed AI hyperrealism. Across four preregistered experiments (total N = 661), we tested whether a novel behavioral intervention, termed DISCERN-AI, improved people’s ability to discriminate between real and synthetic StyleGan2 images. DISCERN-AI combines instructions about which visual features are diagnostic for classifying real and synthetic images with an inductive learning training protocol. In Experiment 1, participants completed a pre-test, DISCERN-AI, and a post-test. In Experiment 2, participants underwent DISCERN-AI or a control task before completing a post-test. In Experiments 3A and 3B, participants completed a shortened version of the intervention or control task, followed by an immediate post-test and a second post-test after 20 days. In all experiments, participants showed below-chance discrimination performance (AI hyperrealism) in the pre-test and control conditions. After completing DISCERN-AI, however, participants consistently showed above-chance discrimination performance, even when tested after 20 days. Together, the results provide support for an easily scalable intervention that substantially improves people’s ability to discriminate between real and synthetic StyleGan2 images.",2025-02-27T19:03:39.270656+00:00,"face perception,deepfake detection,ai hyperrealism,generative ai,artificial intelligence (ai),roc analysis",,,"Philip Anthony Higham, Mansi Pattni, Tina Seabrooke",psyarxiv
E00AE-241-654,Can music genre determine the happiness of a country?,"Music not only serves as an important source in regulating moods but also transcends itself in impacting the happiness of individuals. However, it is not well documented that explores what specific music genre(s) are preferred in countries, whether specific preferences affect happiness, and if moderators such as Suicide, Homicide, Substance abuse and Alcohol abuse interact with genres to determine happiness. To examine this, data were collected from secondary sources from Our World in Data repository and World Happiness Report and Google trends. It was found that the preference for music genres did not contribute to the happiness of any country. However, music genres such as Rap &amp; RnB predicted Homicide, and EDM was associated with Substance abuse. At the same time, genres did not qualify significantly for explaining the variance observed in other moderating variables such as Suicide, Alcohol abuse and Homicide. Regression analysis revealed that happiness increased with lesser Homicide rates and higher Substance abuse",2020-11-22T03:38:28.971484+00:00,,,,"ishaan kapoor, Manas K Mandal, Junmoni Borgohain",psyarxiv
E004C-AEC-C13,Psychosocial Factors Influencing Substance Abuse among Undergraduates,"This study investigated the psychosocial factors influencing substance abuse among undergraduates. The study was conducted in Ekiti State University, Ado Ekiti, Ekiti State, Nigeria. 150 participants who are undergraduates of the university were used in this research. They consist of 82 males and 68 females selected from all faculties in the institution. 3 questionnaires were administered to respondent to measure the factors influencing substance abuse and the level at which they are abused. Independent T-test, multiple regression and Pearson Correlation method were used to analyze the data collected. Five hypotheses were tested: hypothesis 1, 2, 3 and 4 were significant while hypothesis 5 was insignificant. It was observed that there was significant influence of religiosity on substance abuse among undergraduates, the result also revealed that there was a significant influence of self-esteem on substance abuse among undergraduates, it also revealed that religiosity and self-esteem jointly predicted substance abuse among undergraduates, likewise the result also show that there was significant influence of sex on substance abuse among undergraduates and finally the result revealed there was no significant relationship between religiosity and self-esteem among undergraduates.

E0112-992-D77,Childhood Trauma is Associated with Early-Onset but not Late-Onset Suicidal Behavior in Late-Life Depression,"Objectives: To examine the relationship between childhood traumatic experiences and early and late-onset suicidal behavior among depressed older adults. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Inpatient and outpatient psychiatric services in Pennsylvania. Participants: Our sample included 224 adults aged 50+ (M±SD = 62.5±7.4) recruited into three depressed groups: 1) 84 suicide attempters, 2) 44 suicide ideators, and 3) 58 non-suicidal comparisons, and a non-psychiatric healthy comparison group (N = 38). Measurements: The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire measured experiences of childhood trauma such as emotional abuse, physical abuse, emotional neglect, physical neglect, and sexual abuse. Results: Attempters were separated into early- and late- onset based on age of first attempt using a statistical algorithm that identified a cutoff age of 30 years old. Overall, we found group differences in emotional and physical abuse and neglect in both genders and in sexual abuse in females, but not in males. Early-onset attempters experienced more childhood emotional abuse and neglect than late-onset attempters, and were more likely to have experienced multiple forms of abuse. They also experienced more emotional abuse and neglect than all comparison groups. Consistently, early-onset attempters more often met criteria for current or lifetime PTSD relative to late-onset attempters and most comparison groups. Late-onset attempters had similar levels of childhood trauma as other depressed groups. Conclusions: Our study reaffirms that there are distinct pathways to suicidal behavior in older adults based on their age of first suicide attempt, and that trauma experienced in childhood has long-lasting emotional and behavioral consequences, even into late life.",2023-08-03T18:12:22.725040+00:00,,,,"Morgan Buerke, Ya-Wen Yama Chang, Hanga Galfalvy, Katalin Szanto",psyarxiv
E01E0-F1B-3D3,Exploring online buying behaviours: Psychological insights from a comprehensive bibliometric analysis,"The shift from traditional to online shopping is happening at an exponential rate. Numerous terms have emerged recently in the field, such as “impulsive purchasing,” “compulsive buying,” “compulsive consumption,” “impulsive spending patterns,” “revenge buying”, “panic buying,” and “shopping addiction”. The objective of this study is to understand the psychological perspectives associated with online buying. Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) was the source of obtaining publication records from the year 1989 till 2024. Latest version of CiteSpace 6.3.R1 (64-bit) W software was used for mapping and bibliometric analysis. Document co-citation analysis (DCA), author co-citation analysis (ACA), and dual map overlay was analysed by using 813 records. Publication records indicate that a greater number of articles were published during the Covid-19 pandemic. Country network mapping found USA (252) with highest number of publications in the concerned domain. However, in institutional based analysis, it was found that the University of London (22) contributed the maximum number of publications. Author Muller, A (8) had contributed highest number of publications which are mainly focussed on shopping disorder. The largest five clusters, Cluster #1 online compulsive buying, Cluster #2 trust convenience, Cluster #3 state anxiety, Cluster #5 covid-19 pandemic, Cluster #6 Hong Kong were identified by DCA analysis. Keywords with strongest burst were mental health (5.81), community (5.59), purchase intention (4.44), disability (3.88), validation (3.82), risk (3.77), responses (3.74), performance (3.70), internet (3.64) and abuse (3.48), which were the indicators of emerging trend.",2024-07-03T08:27:51.354658+00:00,"online buying,bibliometric,citespace,citation analysis",,,"Mani Abdul Karim, Neha Jha",psyarxiv
E0119-84A-C6E,A Meta-Analysis of Childhood Maltreatment in Relation to Psychopathic Traits,"Psychopathy is a personality disorder characterized by a mix of traits belonging to four facets: affective (e.g., callous/lack of empathy), interpersonal (e.g., grandiosity), behavioral instability (e.g., impulsivity, poor behavioral controls), and social deviance (e.g., juvenile delinquency, criminal versatility). Several scholars have argued that early childhood maltreatment impacts the development of psychopathy, although views regarding its role in the four facets differ. We conducted a meta-analysis including 47 studies comprising a total of 349 effect sizes and 12,737 participants, to investigate the association between the four psychopathy facets and four types of child maltreatment: physical abuse, emotional abuse, neglect, and sexual abuse. We found support for a moderate link between overall psychopathy and childhood physical abuse, emotional abuse, and neglect, as well as overall childhood maltreatment. The link between psychopathy and childhood sexual abuse was small, but still significant. These associations were stronger for the behavioral and antisocial facets than for the affective and interpersonal facets of psychopathy, but nearly all associations were significant. Our findings are consistent with recently developed theories on the role of complex trauma in the development of severe personality disorders.

E0196-059-B2C,Networks of Adversity in Childhood and Adolescence and their Relationship to Adult Mental Health,"Adverse events before the age of eighteen are common and include diverse experiences ranging from sexual abuse to parental divorce. These stressful events have been linked to physical and mental health issues. Previous research has focused mainly on childhood adversity, such as experiences in the family environment. Little consideration has been given to adversities that may be particularly harmful in adolescence. To understand adolescents' adverse experiences, this project used data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, total N = 14,901, N ≈ 1,200-10,000 per measure). We modelled interrelations of adversities in childhood (1-11 years) and adolescence (11-23 years) and examined adversity clusters using network analysis. We found two similar clusters in the childhood and adolescence networks: (1) direct abuse and (2) adverse family factors. We identified a third cluster of (3) educational and social adversities for adolescence. For both age groups, emotional abuse in the family environment was closely linked to mental health in early adulthood and most adversities were linked with depression in early adulthood. In adolescence, housing and academic issues and abuse by a romantic partner were particularly central to the network of adversities. Thus, we found commonalities and differences in the relevance of adverse experiences at different developmental stages. These findings highlight the need to develop age-dependent frameworks for adversity research and policymaking.",2022-06-30T20:51:26.420481+00:00,"development,alspac,network analysis,child abuse,longitudinal cohort studies,emotional abuse",,,"Delia Fuhrmann, Ayla Pollmann, Edward D.

E016D-64E-7A7,Adverse Childhood Experiences and Loneliness: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Adverse childhood experiences are considered a powerful determinant of emotional health. One indicator of emotional health is loneliness, which refers to a distressing experience that one’s social relationships are less in quality and quantity than those desired. This preregistered review aimed to examine the association between adverse childhood experiences (e.g., physical abuse/neglect, emotional abuse/neglect, sexual abuse, parental separation/divorce, family conflict, domestic violence) and loneliness in adulthood. A database search (Embase, Ovid, Cochrane Library, APA PsychINFO, Medline, Pubmed, Scopus) was conducted. After removal of duplicates, 3,689 papers were reviewed and 20 met inclusion criteria. When feasible, results were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis and inverse variance modelling and reported narratively. Meta-analyses revealed a statistically significant association between cumulative adverse childhood experiences and loneliness (r = 0.30, 95% CI [0.22-0.37]; prediction interval = 0.04-0.52) and between specific adversity types and loneliness, namely sexual abuse, physical abuse, physical neglect, emotional abuse, and emotional neglect. Some heterogeneity was observed across studies. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses revealed no differences in age, gender, age group, continent, or measures of adversity/loneliness. This research indicates that adversities in childhood may have some long-term influences on loneliness, both cumulatively and within adversity subtypes.",2024-12-07T10:46:37.070918+00:00,,,,"Elayne Ahern, Aisling Curtis, Eileen K Graham, Emma Kirwan, Páraic O'Súilleabháin, Martina Luchetti, Ann-Marie Creaven, Cian Prendergast",psyarxiv
E0063-973-6AD,Stress and Parenting during the Global COVID-19 Pandemic,"Background: Stress and compromised parenting often place children at risk of abuse and neglect. Child maltreatment has generally been viewed as a highly individualistic problem by focusing on stressors and parenting behaviors that impact individual families. However, because of the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), families across the world are experiencing a new range of stressors that threaten their health, safety, and economic well-being. Objective: This study examined the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to parental perceived stress and child abuse potential. Participants and Setting: Participants included parents (N = 183) with a child under the age of 18 years in the western United States. Method: Tests of group differences and hierarchical multiple regression analyses were employed to assess the relationships among demographic characteristics, COVID-19 related disruptions, mental health risk, protective factors, perceived stress, and child abuse potential. Results: Greater COVID-19 related disruptions and high anxiety and depressive symptoms are associated with higher perceived stress and child abuse potential. In addition, higher perceived stress is associated with higher child abuse potential. Conversely, greater parental support and perceived control during the pandemic may have a protective effect against perceived stress and child abuse potential. Results also indicate racial and ethnic differences in COVID-19 related disruptions, but not in mental health risk, protective factors, perceived stress, or child abuse potential. Conclusion: Findings suggest that although families experience elevated stressors from COVID-19, providing parental support and increasing perceived control may be promising intervention targets.",2020-06-29T20:26:58.140639+00:00,"pandemic,covid-19,child maltreatment,stress,parenting",,,"Tiffany Koppels, Samantha M.

E022B-670-C57,The Social Media Use Scale: Development and Validation,"Social media (SM) use has been primarily operationalized as frequency of use or as passive versus active use. We hypothesize that these constructs have shown mixed associations with psychological constructs because the factor structure underlying social media use (SMU) has not been fully identified. We conducted three studies with college students. In Study 1 (N=176), we collected data about participants’ SMU, informing item generation. In Study 2 (N=311), we tested two factor structures: (1) passive, active social, and active non-social and (2) a hypothesized four-factor structure. Neither confirmatory model produced acceptable fits, but an exploratory factor analysis suggested a four-factor model: Belief-based, consumption-based, image-based, and comparison-based SMU. This four-factor structure was supported in Study 3 (N=397), which was preregistered, via a confirmatory factor analysis. The subscale items showed good internal consistencies, and evidence is presented for convergent validity. These factors represent a novel classification of people’s SMU that can be measured with the Social Media Use Scale.",2023-05-02T00:16:56.206825+00:00,"questionnaire,measure,scale,social media,social media types,social networking sites",,,"Alison Tuck, Renee Thompson",psyarxiv
E015C-A2C-8E3,Navigating image space,"Navigation means getting from here to there. Unfortunately, for biological navigation, there is no agreed definition of what we might mean by `here' or `there'. Computer vision (`Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping', SLAM) uses a 3D world-based coordinate frame but that is a poor model for biological spatial representation. Another possibility is to use an image-based rather than a map-based representation where the observer moves relative to a fixation point. This would require a system for relating different fixation points to one another as the observer moves through the environment. I describe how this can be done by, first, relating fixations to an egocentric representation of visual direction and, second, encoding egocentric representations in a coarse-to-fine hierarchy. The coarsest level of this hierarchy is, in some sense, a world-based frame as it does not vary with eye rotation or observer translation. This representation could be implemented as a `policy', a term used in reinforcement learning to describe a set of states and associated actions, or a `graph' that describes how images or sensory states can be connected by actions. I discuss some of the psychophysical evidence relating to these differing hypotheses about spatial representation and navigation.",2025-01-17T13:30:57.026445+00:00,"navigation,fixation,moving observer,grid cells,spatial representation,optic flow,3d vision",,,Andrew Glennerster,psyarxiv
E01D3-B7B-DB4,"Individual Deep Fake Recognition Skills are Affected by Viewers’ Political Orientation, Agreement with Content and Device Used","AI-generated “deep fakes” are becoming increasingly professional and can be expected to become an essential tool for cybercriminals conducting targeted and tailored social engineering attacks, as well as for others aiming for influencing public opinion in a more general sense. While the technological arms race is resulting in increasingly efficient forensic detection tools, these are unlikely to be in place and applied by common users on an everyday basis any time soon, especially if social engineering attacks are camouflaged as unsuspicious conversations. To date, most cybercriminals do not yet have the necessary resources, competencies or the required raw material featuring the target to produce perfect impersonifications. To raise awareness and efficiently train individuals in recognizing the most widespread deep fakes, the understanding of what may cause individual differences in the ability to recognize them can be central. Previous research suggested a close relationship between political attitudes and top-down perceptual and subsequent cognitive processing styles. In this study, we aimed to investigate the impact of political attitudes and agreement with the political message content on the individual’s deep fake recognition skills. In this study, 163 adults (72 females = 44.2%) judged a series of video clips with politicians’ statements across the political spectrum regarding their authenticity and their agreement with the message that was transported. Half of the presented videos were fabricated via lip-sync technology. In addition to the particular agreement to each statement made, more global political attitudes towards social and economic topics were assessed via the Social and Economic Conservatism Scale (SECS). Data analysis revealed robust negative associations between participants’ general and in particular social conservatism and their ability to recognize fabricated videos. This effect was pronounced where there was a specific agreement with the message content. Deep fakes watched on mobile phones and tablets were considerably less likely to be recognized as such compared to when watched on stationary computers. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate and establish the association between political attitudes and interindividual differences in deep fake recognition. The study further supports very recently published research suggesting relationships between conservatism and perceived credibility of conspiracy theories and fake news in general. Implications for further research on psychological mechanisms underlying this effect are discussed.",2021-12-30T14:24:35.177365+00:00,"fake news,deepfakes,conservatism,deep fakes,recognition,political orientation,cybercrime,perception,social media,social engineering",,,"Matthew Canham, Leandra Wolf, Torvald F.

E013D-0D1-8B7,The association between childhood maltreatment and thermal pain sensitivity in a high-risk adolescent population,"Background – research on childhood maltreatment and pain sensitivity has produced opposing hypothesis. One line of research proposes maltreatment leads to developmental impairment of the central nervous system and thus more sensitivity to pain. Another posits childhood maltreatment leads to habituation of pain and thus lower sensitivity. Empirical research in adolescents so far has relied on potentially biased self-report measures or on highly selective populations. Methods – a sample (n =187) from a population-based cohort of adolescents at high-risk for psychopathology (ages 16.7 to 20.5) completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire short form (CTQ-SF) to assess emotional, physical, sexual abuse, and emotional and physical neglect. To asses pain sensitivity, a thermal quantitative sensory testing procedure was used which measured when adolescents felt pain from hot and cold stimuli. Multilevel ordered beta regressions were used to estimate the associations adjusted for age, sex and internalizing problems. Results – individuals reporting childhood emotional abuse or neglect and physical neglect could on average withstand hot and cold pain of 1.03°C [0.13, 1.84] to 3.20°C [0.62, 5.97] more across different types of abuse compared to those with no emotional abuse or (physical) neglect history. Physical abuse was not associated with pain sensitivity. Sexual abuse was only associated with cold and not with hot pain sensitivity. Discussion – the current findings suggest that childhood maltreatment might lead to habituation to painful stimuli as opposed to increased pain sensitivity",2024-05-01T08:54:11.849996+00:00,"pain sensitivity,adolescents,childhood maltreatment,pain,trauma",,,"Thomas G de Leeuw, Milan Zarchev, Astrid Kamperman, Witte JG Hoogendijk, Maaike Dirckx, Cornelis Mulder, Nina Grootendorst",psyarxiv
E0196-844-88B,Exploring the Dimensional Structure of Subjective Interoception and the Differential Impact of Abuse and Neglect,"Background: Subjective interoception plays a critical role in emotional well-being, but its constituents have rarely been examined. Additionally, little attention has been paid to how abuse and neglect, as two distinct yet often co-occurring dimensions of child maltreatment, may differentially impact subjective interoception. Objective: The present study aimed to examine the dimensional structure of subjective interoception, and how its different dimensions are associated with internalizing psychopathology and are differentially influenced by abuse and neglect. Participants and Setting: Participants (N = 391; Mage = 19.29 years; female: 67.5%; Hispanic: 57.3%) were recruited in 2021-2022 as part of a larger study. Methods: Exploratory graph and confirmatory factor analyses were used to establish the dimensional structure of subjective interoception, and structural equation modeling was used to examine the relationships between different dimensions of subjective interoception, abuse and neglect, as well as internalizing psychopathology. Results: The results suggested that subjective interoception was comprised of two dimensions: proactive and reactive interoception. Whereas abuse was positively associated with reactive interoception only, neglect was negatively associated with both proactive and reactive interoception. Proactive, but not reactive, interoception was negatively associated with internalizing psychopathology. Conclusions: The findings provide compelling evidence for the differential impact of abuse and neglect on different facets of subjective interoception, highlighting the significance of considering abuse and neglect as two distinct experiential elements. The results also inspire the idea that emotion-body connection should be considered in future emotional development research.",2024-07-08T03:33:52.774339+00:00,"child maltreatment,internalizing psychopathology,subjective interoception",,,"Sara R.

How do people locate an object, right now, in front of them? In three experiments collecting over 35,000 judgements on stimuli spanning different levels of realism (line drawings, real images, and crude forms), participants clicked “where” an object is, as if pointing to it. We modeled their responses with eight different methods, including both human response-based models (judgements of physical reasoning, spatial memory, free-response “click anywhere” judgements, and judgements of where people would grab the object), and image-based models (uniform distributions over the image, convex hull, saliency map, and medial axis). Physical reasoning was the best predictor of “where,” performing significantly better than even spatial memory and free-response judgements.

E01A6-65A-865,Further investigation on sexual abuse experiences – Revisiting the psychometric properties of the Sexual Abuse History Questionnaire and the content of its open-ended item,"Introduction: Numerous studies have assessed sexual abuse (SA) in association with psychological consequences, psychiatric disorders, or somatic disorders. However, assessing such a complex psychological construct faces both methodological and theoretical difficulties. Method: The aim of this study was to examine the validity and reliability of the Sexual Abuse History Questionnaire (SAHQ) in a large, non-clinical sample (N=24715), and to identify other potential manifestations of sexual abuse using an open-ended question (e.g., groping, nonphysical coercion, consent regarding sexual health and the reproductive system). Results: Two subsamples were created to perform both EFA and CFA, since no pre-established factor structure existed for the scale. The exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses identified a one-factor structure in sexual abuse both in childhood (CSA) and adolescence/adulthood (AASA). AASA and CSA showed a moderate positive correlation in both subsamples. Both AASA and CSA correlated positively with compulsive sexual behavior, sexual dysfunction, number of sexual partners, and negatively with problematic pornography consumption, although these associations were weak. Our qualitative analysis indicated eight additional categories of SA that the scale did not measure. Conclusions: Our quantitative analyses showed adequate reliability but insufficient criterion validity for the SAHQ. Our qualitative analyses indicated that the scale is presumably not able to measure sexual abuse in its full complexity. Policy Implications: The present research may point to the need to apply broader definitions of sexual abuse when it comes to designing interventions or treatment for SA survivors, as they can result in more personalised, inclusive, and effective intervention programs.",2023-11-01T14:01:31.832357+00:00,,,,"Mónika Koós, Léna Nagy, Zsolt Demetrovics, Buczó Dóra, Beáta Bőthe",psyarxiv
E0045-FB0-3CB,The Experience of Individuals Filmed for Pornography Production: A History of Continuous Polyvictimization and Ongoing Mental Health Challenges,"Purpose: While research and public debate have increasingly focused on the effects of pornography consumption, the experiences of those documented in pornography have been largely overlooked. This study aims to address this gap by examining the vulnerabilities and health risks faced by this population. Materials and methods: Individuals aged 18 and older documented in pornography in Sweden were recruited to participate in face-to-face interviews. A total of 120 participants completed study-specific questions and standardized questionnaires on their background, experiences in pornography, and health status. Descriptive statistics were reported, and regression analyses were performed to assess factors impacting PTSD symptom severity and dissociative symptoms. Results: Participants reported high levels of abuse both in childhood and during pornography production. Nearly all participants had experienced sexual abuse (88%), psychological abuse (90%), and physical abuse (79%) as children. In the context of pornography production, they were subjected to further abuse and exploitation, including verbal abuse (87%), rape (65%), physical assault (56%), third-party control (56%), and online harassment (57%). The consequences of this continuous polyvictimization were significant: 84% exhibited clinically significant PTSD symptoms, 60% clinically significant dissociative symptoms, 69% had attempted suicide, and 80% had been diagnosed with at least one mental health problem. Regression analyses revealed that childhood and online polyvictimization significantly predicted PTSD symptom severity, while polyvictimization within pornography production predicted dissociative symptoms. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the urgent need for comprehensive mental health interventions and legal reform to protect this vulnerable population and address the unique harms stemming from documentation in pornography.",2025-02-18T07:59:02.624306+00:00,"mental health,childhood abuse,pornography production,polyvictimization,ptsd",,,"Meghan Donevan, Linda S.

E01FD-A76-A83,The Predictive Validity of Intimate Partner Violence Warning Signs,"Intimate partner violence (IPV) is harmful and prevalent, but leaving abusive partners is often challenging due to investments (e.g., children, shared memories). Identifying warning signs of abuse early on is one prevention strategy to help people avoid abusive long-term relationships. Using university and online samples, the present studies identified warning signs and protective factors that predicted overall, physical, psychological, and sexual abuse cross-sectionally (Study 1) and prospectively over six months (Study 2). These studies demonstrated that the number of warning signs a person experienced and the frequency with which they experienced those warning signs predicted overall abuse. Seven warning signs emerged as predictors in both studies (e.g., “My partner acted arrogant or entitled”), suggesting they are particularly important for identifying potentially abusive relationships. This is the first research to identify warning signs that prospectively predict abuse; findings have implications for IPV prevention efforts in academic and public contexts.

We developed a self-report instrument on Cognitions and Emotions about Child Sexual Abuse (CECSA) that may predict individual propensity for interviewer bias. Three subscales, 23 items in total, were created in a sample of 801 humanities students via exploratory factor analysis and Ant Colony Optimization. The “Naïve Confidence” subscale reflects overestimating one's ability to recognize abused children and overestimating the accuracy of children’s abuse reports, the ""Emotional Reactivity"" subscale measures the intensity of one's emotional reactions towards the topic of child sexual abuse (CSA), and the ""Justice System Distrust"" subscale covers distrusting the justice system’s ability to prosecute CSA. The CECSA showed adequate model fit and good internal consistencies. Correlations with other self-report measures demonstrated convergent validity. All subscales predicted biased evaluations towards the abuse hypothesis in scenarios of children displaying unspecific behavioral problems. This indicates predictive validity of the CECSA to measure vulnerability for interviewer bias, although further validation effort is needed. Prospectively, the CECSA may be used to evaluate interviewer trainings or to assess training needs of professionals who talk to children about CSA suspicions.",2025-02-05,,,,"Elsa Gewehr, Pekka Olavi Santtila, Renate Volbert, Simone Pülschen, Marie Merschhemke",psyarxiv
E020E-02D-C6F,Genetic Vulnerability to Experiencing Child Maltreatment,"Although there are multiple forms of experiences of childhood maltreatment (CM), previous research has mainly focused on its different aspects separately. Possible genetic influences on these purportedly environmental causes of later psychopathology have also been largely overlooked. In a large population-based Finnish twin-sample, we investigated the co-occurrence of 55 different adverse experiences and the covariance of the identified latent types of CM. We also estimated the genetic and environmental influences on both the individual adverse experiences and latent types of CM. We found evidence that the reported CM are influenced by genetic factors. Importantly, specific genetic and environmental factors still influenced traits that modulate the risk of sexual abuse after accounting for shared genetic influences on all types of CM and on their covariance. Genes and shared environments differently influenced the occurrence of CM within and outside the family. Finally, we found evidence that heritable traits might bias retrospective self-reports of experiences more susceptible to interpretation.",2018-04-24T09:38:42.466573+00:00,"sexual abuse,emotional abuse,gender differences,gene- environment correlation,neglect,cohort effects,response bias,child maltreatment,heritability,adverse childhood experiences,physical abuse",,,"Patrizia Pezzoli, Jan Antfolk, Alexander Samir Hatoum, Pekka Santtila",psyarxiv
E01B7-9A7-7E6,How did UK social distancing restrictions affect the lives of women experiencing intimate partner violence during the COVID-19 pandemic? A qualitative exploration of survivor views,"Background: An increase of domestic abuse cases was reported at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, with many people living with abuse facing additional barriers to seeking support. Available evidence suggests women are overrepresented in the reported cases of intimate partner violence (IPV) and we aimed to learn more about how their lives were impacted by social distancing restrictions. Methods: We conducted a qualitative interview study, using reflexive thematic analysis. Interviews were conducted between April 2021 and March 2022. 18 women in the UK with past experiences of IPV provided informed consent and participated in this study. Results: We identified five themes related to the experiences of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions on the lives of the participants. Firstly, lockdown meant being confined to a place where abuse was escalating in frequency and intensity. Participants described fear, isolation, and loss of control during the early stages of the pandemic from the combination of abuse and pandemic-related changes to daily life. However, psychosocial wellbeing and identity underwent a transformation when abuse ended during lockdown, with many participants using the word “freedom” when reflecting on their experience of living through the COVID-19 pandemic. We identified key barriers that prevented access to support for IPV, including “cancelled” services and missed opportunities to intervene during interactions in lockdown with frontline workers. Paradoxically, some participants found other forms of support were more readily available, such as provision of online psychological support and social groups. Conclusions: In this study, we explored the views of female survivors of IPV in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results highlight the importance of combined public awareness campaigns and community intervention points for victims to safely seek help during social distancing restrictions. Having the time and space to reflect on healing after escaping abuse was described by women in our study as a benefit from their lives in lockdown, which is a factor that could be incorporated into future initiatives developed to support people subjected to violence and abuse.",2022-07-05T15:20:19.256615+00:00,"intimate partner violence,social support,domestic violence,public health,wellbeing,mental health",,,"Tom May, Alexandra Burton, Alison McKinlay, Yochi Simon, Daisy Fancourt",psyarxiv
E01D3-BCB-4A1,Childhood abuse and adult socio-cognitive skills: Distinguishing between self and other following early trauma,"Experience of childhood abuse impairs complex social functioning in children; however, much less is known about its effects on basic socio-cognitive processes and even fewer studies have investigated these in adult survivors. Using two behavioral tasks, this study investigated spontaneous theory of mind (ToM) and imitative behavior in 41 women with childhood abuse (CA) and 26 unaffected comparison women (UC). In the spontaneous ToM task, UCs showed a larger ToM index than CAs, indicating more facilitation by knowledge of another’s false belief. In the imitation-inhibition task, CAs experienced less interference than UCs when observing another’s incongruent movements. After controlling for depression, differences in ToM became marginally significant, yet remained highly significant for inhibiting imitative behavior. The findings suggest childhood abuse survivors have altered perspective-taking, and are less influenced by others’ perspectives, potentially due to changes in self-other distinction. Clinical implications regarding therapeutic practice with survivors of childhood abuse are discussed.",2019-08-12T16:56:27.919577+00:00,"maltreatment,theory of mind,trauma,imitative behavior,self-other distinction",,,"Lize De Coster, Sylvia Verbeke, Marcel Brass, Hanne Spoormans, Anna Hudson, Sven C Mueller, Kaat Van der Jeught",psyarxiv
E004F-7C2-3B9,Confirmation Bias in Simulated Child Sexual Abuse (CSA) Interviews: Abuse Assumption Influences Interviewing and Decision-making Processes,"Purpose Research has shown that confirmation bias plays a role in legal and forensic decision-making processes. However, to our knowledge, no study has examined how it manifests itself when interviewing an allegedly abused child. Method In the present study, we used data from a series of experiments in which participants interviewed child avatars to examine how an assumption of abuse based on preliminary information influenced decision-making and interviewing style. Interview training data from eight studies with students, psychologists and police officers were included in the analyses. Results We found that interviewers’ preliminary assumption of sexual abuse having taken place predicted 1) a conclusion of abuse by the interviewers after the interview; 2) higher confidence in their judgment; 3) more frequent use of not recommended question types and 4) a decreased likelihood of reaching a correct conclusion given the same number of available relevant details. Conclusion The importance of considering how preliminary assumptions of abuse affect interview behaviour and outcomes and the implications for the training of investigative interviewers were discussed.",2022-01-16T13:53:49.166264+00:00,"child interviewing,mega-analysis,child sexual abuse (csa),confirmation bias",,,"Aleksandr Segal, Francesco Pompedda, Shumpei Haginoya, Pekka Santtila, Yikang Zhang",psyarxiv
E0095-349-5F4,Humanizing pedophilia as stigma reduction: A large-scale intervention study,"Abstract The stigmatization of people with pedophilic sexual interests is the topic of growing academic and professional consideration, owing to its potential role in moderating pedophiles’ emotional wellbeing, and motivation and engagement in child abuse prevention schemes. Thus, improving attitudes and reducing stigmatization toward this group is of paramount importance. Prior research has suggested that narrative humanization – presenting personal stories of self-identified non-offending pedophiles – could be one route to doing this. However, this work has only been conducted with students or trainee psychotherapists, meaning the public generalizability of this method is still unknown. In this study, we compared two stigma interventions to test whether narratives reduce stigma toward people with pedophilic interests more effectively than an informative alternative (scientific information about pedophilia). Using a longitudinal experimental design with a lack of non-intervention control (initial N = 950; final N = 539), we found that narratives had consistently positive effects on all measured aspects of stigmatization (dangerousness, intentionality), whereas an informative alternative had mixed results, and actually increased perceptions of pedophiles’ levels of deviance. These effects were also still present four months after the initial presentation. We discuss these data in relation to ongoing debates about treating pedophilia as a public health issue requiring a broad societal approach to wellbeing and child abuse prevention.",2019-03-27T18:37:17.826521+00:00,"st-iat,sexual abuse,sexual abuse prevention,iatgen,forensic psychology,implicit association test,pedophilia,sexual crime,public attitudes,social attitudes,child sexual abuse",,,"Nicholas Blagden, Rebecca Lievesley, Kerensa Hocken, Craig A.

E01D7-FE8-450,Volitional control of piloerection: objective evidence and its potential utility in neuroscience research,"The ability of volitional control of piloerection has been reported in a rare subset of individuals. This ability may be useful to study involuntary emotional piloerection, as research on this phenomenon has suffered from low reproducibility. However, objective evidence at a group-level and stability under experimental constraints remain to be examined. The present study aimed to validate existing findings of voluntary generated piloerection (VGP) and to examine its potential contribution to neuroscientific research based on objective evidence of this ability. In Study 1, to confirm the characteristics of VGP reported in previous studies and identify individuals with VGP capability, an online survey of VGP candidates found through a large-scale screening was conducted. In Study 2, a total of 18 VGP holders participated in a mail-based piloerection measurement experiment, and the nature of VGP was examined based on the objective evidence obtained by image-based analysis (GooseLab). The results of the web survey largely recapitulated the characteristics of VGP reported in previous studies, and objective measurements revealed the utility of this ability in neuroscientific research. For some participants, VGP appeared to be emotionally promoted, which suggests that VGP shares the emotional nature of involuntary piloerection. The findings from this study demonstrated the possible contribution of VGP to elucidating the mechanism of involuntary emotional piloerection and the neural basis of piloerection itself.",2019-10-29T08:01:18.515457+00:00,"volitional control,emotion,piloerection,objective measurement,autonomic,goose bumps",,,"Ai Kawakami, Noriko Nagata, Akitoshi Tomita, Kenji Katahira",psyarxiv
E0097-83B-07F,Mental imagery and its role in the psychopathology and treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder: a systematic review and narrative synthesis,"Whilst intrusive mental imagery represents a diagnostic feature of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), research is lacking with most focussing on intrusive thoughts. Moreover, it has been argued that mental imagery might represent a unique form of OCD symptomatology and could be harnessed to treat symptoms. We performed a systematic review, adopting a two-phased approach, to examine the role of mental imagery in both the psychopathology and treatment of OCD. First, we explored the characteristics and pathological features of intrusive imagery in OCD. Second, we evaluated literature examining imagery-based interventions, i.e., Imagery Rescripting (ImRs) and Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR), in treating symptoms. Findings identify distressing mental imagery as a prominent feature in OCD. Intrusive imagery in OCD was characterised as vivid distressing visual images often accompanied by bodily sensations. Compared to other anxiety disorders, intrusive imagery in OCD occurred more frequently, which often led people to believe they possessed a “dangerous self”. Up to 89% of OCD patients reported experiencing intrusive imagery, with 70% to 79% also reporting that the intrusions related to adverse or traumatic events. Image-based treatments like ImRs and EMDR were found to be promising in reducing symptoms, providing an effective alternative treatment for patients suffering intrusive imagery.",2025-03-19,,,,"Michael Bloomfield, Alexandra Badaoui, Chris Brewin, Margherita Zenoni, James Bisby, Stephanie Archer, Amy L Milton",psyarxiv

We recruited 540 Chinese adults and examined: (1) factorial validity and internal consistency, (2) convergent validity, (3) divergent validity, and (4) gender measurement invariance in a Chinese version of the PMR. With minor modifications, model fit for the confirmatory factor model in the overall sample was acceptable and convergent validity was demonstrated. However, model fit for males was poor, which led to the conclusion that gender configural invariance did not hold. Overall, the Chinese version of the PMR appears to produce scores that are valid and reliable for measuring psychological maltreatment in the general population though further work will be required to understand how to measure the concept in a valid and comparable way across genders.",2022-03-14T19:25:46.657075+00:00,"psychological abuse,child abuse,psychological support,psychological neglect,mental health,psychological maltreatment review (pmr)",,,"Aja Louise Murray, Franziska Meinck, Ingrid Obsuth, Zhuoni Xiao",psyarxiv
E0120-6AA-61D,“Abusers are using COVID to enhance abuse”: Domestic abuse helpline workers’ perspectives on the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on those living with domestic abuse,"Purpose: Mobility restrictions enforced by the UK Government in March 2020 as a response to COVID-19 resulted in those vulnerable to domestic abuse being confined in isolation with their abusers, deprived of safe spaces and many of their usual sources of support. Domestic abuse helplines therefore became an increasingly vital avenue for victim support, seeing a substantial increase in service demand during lockdown periods. Method: Through semi-structured interviews with 11 domestic abuse helpline workers across UK services dedicated to a diverse range of populations, this project examined the nature and frequency of calls received since the first COVID-19 lockdown period. Results: Key themes identified through thematic analysis were: 1) Abusers weaponising government guidelines to justify and intensify abuse, and restrictions acting as both a barrier and facilitator to leaving an abusive relationship; 2) A loss of previously accessed support, with users uncertain about what help was available and issues around engaging with new forms of support; and 3) Isolation from social support networks, with callers reporting a loss of respite, lack of emotional and practical support, removal of third-party abuse monitoring opportunities, and subsequent mental health implications. Conclusions: These findings will act as a crucial guide for policy decision-making regarding support needs emerging from the pandemic and beyond, highlighting the importance of multi-agency partnerships, and urging caution in the utility of virtual alternatives to face-to-face support longer-term.",2022-02-04T18:34:24.255864+00:00,,,,"Roxanne Hawkins, Jack McKinlay, Zara Brodie, Chloe MacLean",psyarxiv
E0055-329-CBA,Determinants of victimization in patients with severe mental illness: results from a nation-wide cross-sectional survey in the Netherlands,"We aimed to examine determinants of criminal victimization (i.e. both personal and property crime victimization) in outpatients with severe mental illness. Data was collected using a multisite epidemiological survey including a random sample of 956 adult outpatients with SMI. Data on 12-month victimization prevalence and frequency were obtained using the victimization scale of the Dutch Crime and Victimization Survey. Demographic characteristics, clinical diagnosis, psychosocial functioning, drug use and alcohol abuse over the past 12 months, co-morbid PTSD diagnosis, physical abuse, physical neglect and sexual abuse in childhood, perpetration of violence over the past 12-months, and anger disposition were assessed as determinants. Univariable and multivariable hurdle regression analyses were conducted to test associations of the potential determinants with victimization prevalence and frequency. We found that different sets of demographic and clinical characteristics were associated with personal and property crime victimization. Clinical characteristics were more pronounced regarding personal crime victimization. In the multivariable model, presence of psychotic disorder, drug use, childhood physical and sexual abuse, and recent violent perpetration were associated with the 12-month prevalence or frequency rate of personal crime victimization. Native Dutch and divorced patients were more at risk as well. Next to this being employed, poor social functioning, having perpetrated a violent crime, as well as alcohol abuse and recent drug use were all significantly related to property crime prevalence or frequency rate in the multivariable model.",2023-03-07T16:44:09.664270+00:00,"nationwide,victimization,crime,aggression,epidemiology,psychiatry,determinants",,,"Anneke van Schaik, Sten Willemsen, Emmanuel Lesaffre, Jens Henrichs, Cornelis Mulder, Wilma Swildens, Milan Zarchev, Philippe Delespaul, Hans Kroon, Dike van de Mheen, Mark van der Gaag, Astrid Kamperman, Jaap van Weeghel, Yolanda Nijssen, Bogaerts, Stefan",psyarxiv
E00ED-524-9A8,Efficient Intimate Partner Violence Measurement: Psychometric Properties of a Spanish-Language Version of the Composite Abuse Scale (Revised) – Short Form (CASR-SF),"The Composite Abuse Scale (Revised) – Short Form (CASR-SF) was developed with the aim of providing a brief, reliable, and valid self-report measure that could adequately capture the complexity of intimate partner violence (IPV). Unlike many commonly used IPV instruments, it is a multidimensional measure that is appropriate for diverse groups and contexts and can be easily incorporated in population-based surveys or studies with multiple scales. Despite these benefits, however, there is limited evidence regarding the psychometric properties of the CASR-SF. Thus, the current study aimed to perform a broad validation study of a new Spanish-language version of the CASR-SF. A large community sample of adults residing in the Dominican Republic was recruited (n = 1,117; age = 18-74; 82.7% female). Overall, the content validity, dimensionality, factor structure, measurement invariance, criterion validity, and reliability assessments indicated that the Spanish-language CASR-SF was a valid and reliable measure of the four core dimensions of IPV: sexual abuse, physical abuse, psychological abuse, and stalking, the latter a novel finding of this study. The structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses revealed several at-risk populations for IPV, including females, sexual minorities (lesbian/gay/bisexual), and those with lower economic and education levels. Additionally, psychological abuse emerged as the IPV dimension most consistently and uniquely related with negative mental health outcomes, including depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The collective evidence of this study suggests that the CASR-SF is an excellent tool for the research of IPV victimization across cultures.",2022-10-27T19:31:36.425867+00:00,"dimensionality assessment,intimate partner violence,scale validation,structural equation modeling,mental health",,,"Cinthia Abreu-Mariot, Daniella Peñaló-Sánchez, Maite Frías-Hiciano, Luis Eduardo Garrido, Lisanna Pérez-Estévez, Agustín Martínez-Molina, Evelyn Zoraya Lara Caba",psyarxiv

This study utilized data from a large, population-based sample of Norwegian youth aged 12–16 years and employed generalized linear models to examine whether current and past peak subjective distress following physical abuse were associated with mental and somatic symptoms, measured by the Hopkin’s Symptoms Checklist (HSCL-10) and the Children’s Somatic Symptoms Inventory (CSSI-8). Causal mediation analyses were conducted to investigate whether subjective distress mediated the relationship between physical abuse and health outcomes. Subjective distress accounted for significant variation in health outcomes, above and beyond externally defined features of physical abuse, such as severity and frequency. Notably, the impact of physical abuse on health outcomes was largely transmitted through experiences of subjective distress. While externally defined characteristics of maltreatment remain important predictors of health outcomes, this study underscores the necessity of incorporating measures of subjective experience to fully understand the pathways linking childhood maltreatment to later health outcomes.",2025-09-11,"Childhood maltreatment,Frequency,Mental and somatic health,Physical abuse,Severity,Subjective distress",,,"Mari Skogseth Fuglesang, Marte Svartsund Thomassen, Else-Marie Augusti, Lia Ferschmann, Gertrud Sofie Hafstad, Sjur Skjørshammer Sætren",psyarxiv

E00E8-1D3-A26,Psychometric evidence for indirect assessment of child abuse risk in child welfare-involved mothers,"Most research on factors related to physical child abuse risk rely heavily on direct self-report measures, which is a methodological strategy susceptible to participant response distortions. Such methodological reliance obfuscates the interpretations rendered about the risk factors predictive of child abuse. Efforts to develop alternative indirect assessment approaches, such as analog tasks, show promise, although most of those studies have applied these methods to community samples rather than with child welfare-involved samples. The present study evaluated the psychometric evidence for four separate analog tasks that have not yet been considered with mothers identified for child maltreatment by child welfare services, also contrasted to a sociodemographically matched sample of mothers. The results indicate acceptable reliability for the analog tasks, with additional evidence of validity. However, the two groups of mothers did not substantively differ across measures, suggesting that identification for abuse through child protective services does not differentiate from those closely matched on critical sociodemographic characteristics. The promis-ing preliminary results on these analog tasks in the current study suggest that indirect analog as-sessment approaches to estimate child abuse risk could be useful in efforts to minimize depend-ence on self-report methods.",2022-03-01T19:06:55.508249+00:00,"case control,child maltreatment,social informatino processing theory,analog assessment,child abuse,indirect assessment,implicit assessment",,,"Christina Rodriguez, Paul Silvia",psyarxiv
E0097-1FD-BBC,"Borderline personality pathology, health behavior, and inflammation: Potential behavioral and biological mechanisms underlying childhood physical abuse and age-related disease","The frequent comorbidity of psychiatric and physical health conditions may be partially attributable to early life stress-related changes in inflammatory signaling and behavior (e.g., borderline personality pathology, health behaviors) that reciprocally maintain and enhance their effects on overall health. Using data from older adults (N=1,630) who participated in the ongoing longitudinal St Louis Personality and Aging Network (SPAN) study, we examined associations between childhood physical abuse, borderline personality pathology, inflammation markers (i.e., interleukin-6 [IL-6], C-reactive protein [CRP]), health behaviors, and physical health. Morning fasting serum IL-6 and CRP were assayed from a subset of participants (n=791). Borderline pathology factor scores were computed using interviews as well as self- and informant-reports across the course of the study. Physical health, health behaviors, and additional covariates (e.g., medication use) were also assessed. IL-6 was associated with higher BPD symptomatology, greater exposure to childhood physical abuse, worse physical health, and lower preventative health behaviors (all p values &lt; 10-11). Similar findings for CRP emerged, though the association with childhood physical abuse was not robust to covariate inclusion. An integrated model suggests an indirect pathway between exposure to childhood physical abuse, greater BPD symptomology, reduced preventative health behaviors, elevated IL-6, and worse health outcomes (-0.07, p &lt; .001). These findings suggest that physical abuse during childhood may be predictive of later poor physical health through behavioral (i.e., borderline pathology, reduced preventative health behaviors), and biological (i.e., inflammatory) pathways.",2021-03-13T06:25:37.683266+00:00,,,,"Lindsay Michalski, Christina Diiorio, Ryan Bogdan, Thomas Oltmanns, Jonathan Winstone, Sara Norton, Katharine Chang, Michael J.

E01BF-76C-ED7,Childhood Emotional Abuse and Suicidal Ideation Intensity: The Serial Effects of Rejection Sensitivity and Thwarted Interpersonal Needs,"Background: Rejection sensitivity (hypersensitivity and reactivity to threats of rejection due to previous rejection experiences) could provide insight into the role of childhood emotional abuse and associated interpersonal risk factors in the development of suicide ideation (SI). Objective: The current study examined SI among at-risk young adults using an integrated model of rejection sensitivity and suicide risk, as conceptualized by the interpersonal theory of suicide. We hypothesized that childhood emotional abuse would be indirectly prospectively associated with increases in SI intensity at 4-month follow-up (a cognitive-affective reaction to rejection) through greater rejection sensitivity and greater perceptions of rejection (thwarted belonging [TB] and perceived burden [PB]), in serial. Participants and Setting: Participants were 148 young adult men and women (ages 18-35) with SI and/or suicidal behaviors within the past 4 months. Participants were recruited as part of a larger one-year longitudinal study of suicide risk in a transdiagnostic sample of young adults. Methods: PROCESS serial mediation procedures were used to test the hypothesis that emotional abuse would be indirectly associated with increased SI intensity at 4-month follow-up through rejection sensitivity and TB or PB, in serial. Results: Results indicated that childhood emotional abuse was prospectively associated with elevated SI intensity in adulthood through the indirect effects of rejection sensitivity and PB (std. est. = .04; 95% CI = -0.03, 0.11) but not TB. Conclusion: Greater emotional abuse in childhood was associated with a greater sensitivity to rejection, which may perpetuate a cycle that increases risk for SI throughout adolescence and adulthood.",2025-01-28T18:54:08.610579+00:00,,,,"Lori N.

Methods: In the current study, we test McLaughlin &amp; Sheridan’s (2016) model in a sample of 11,800 community youth (ages 9-15 years old) enrolled in the nationwide, longitudinal Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study to examine the impact of PTE types on SU. We analyze concurrent associations between PTE types (physical abuse, domestic violence, community violence, emotional neglect, poverty, and institutionalization / deprivation) and substance use (pooling alcohol, cannabis, or nicotine) and prospective associations whereby exposure to different PTE types predicts SU one year later (self-medication hypothesis). Results: For concurrent associations, we find emotional neglect and physical abuse were significantly positively related to SU. In terms of prospective associations, institutionalization / deprivation, emotional neglect, and physical abuse significantly positively predicted SU. A majority of associations between PTE types and SU were accounted for by other PTE types and time-varying covariates (e.g., internalizing/externalizing symptoms). The association between PTEs and SU during adolescence varies across PTE types. PTEs categorized as physical abuse and emotional neglect are more likely to lead to SU.

E01E3-564-38E,"Thanking, Apologizing, Bragging, and Blaming: Responsibility Exchange Theory and the Currency of Communication","From the time we are children, we are taught to say “thank you” and “I’m sorry.” These communications are central to many social interactions, and the failure to say them often leads to conflict in relationships. Research has documented that, alongside the impact they can have on relationships, apologies and thanks can also impact material outcomes as small as restaurant tips and as significant as settlements of medical malpractice lawsuits. But, it is trivial to utter the words; how can such “cheap talk” carry so much value? In this paper, we propose a “responsibility exchange theory” that explains why these communications are not costless, and which draws connections between four forms of communication that have not previously been connected: thanking, apologizing, bragging, and blaming. All four of these communications relay information about credit or blame, and thus introduce image-based costs and benefits for both the communicator and the recipient of communication: Each of the four communications involves a tradeoff between appearing competent and appearing warm. By formalizing these social psychological insights with a utility-based approach to modeling communication, and by applying game theoretic analysis, we offer new insights about social communication. We test several of the model’s novel predictions about strategic communication in two experiments: The first involves hypothetical choices in a scenario study, and the second involves real choices in a live interaction. We end with a discussion of the theory’s place in the literature and consider extended predictions and applications as examples of future directions for research.",2017-09-12T14:19:08.346599+00:00,"interpersonal communication,politeness,warmth and competence,impression management,incivility,credit and blame,conflict management,interpersonal relationships,responsibility attribution,self-presentation,social image concern,signaling,person perception",,,"George Loewenstein, Shereen Jehan Chaudhry",psyarxiv
E021C-C37-106,Modeling the effects of perisaccadic attention on gaze statistics during scene viewing,"How we perceive a visual scene depends critically on the selection of gaze positions by a series of saccadic eye movements (scan path). In this selection process, visual attention is known to play a key role in two ways. First, models of image-based visual attention are able to predict the time-independent eye-fixation density. Second, millisecond-level attentional dynamics around the time of saccade drives our gaze from one position to the next. These two related research areas on attention are typically perceived as separate, both theoretically and experimentally. Here we link the two research areas by demonstrating that perisaccadic attentional dynamics improve predictions on scan path statistics in scene viewing. In a dynamical mathematical model, we identified two new theoretical principles to be essential, (i) perisaccadic covert attention for the explanation of a saccadic momentum effect and (ii) delayed inactivation of recently fixated regions for facilitation of return saccades. Our model reproduces saccade amplitude distributions, angular statistics, intersaccadic turning angles, and their impact on fixation durations as well as inter-individual differences between observers. Results are obtained from data assimilation of the mathematical model in a fully Bayesian framework that permitted rigorous statistical inference. We conclude that bridging the gap between static visual attention models and perisaccadic attentional dynamics is important for the prediction of human scene exploration behavior.",2020-04-08T08:33:05.480374+00:00,"scan path,attention,attention modelling,eye movement,fixation modelling,scenewalk,eye tracking,modelling",,,"Hans Trukenbrod, Lisa Schwetlick, Lars Rothkegel, Ralf Engbert",psyarxiv
E022C-761-F4E,Visual intuitions in the absence of visual experience: the role of direct experience in concreteness and imageability judgements,"The strongest formulations of grounded cognition assume that perceptual intuitions about concepts involve the re-activation of sensorimotor experience we have made with their referents in the world. Within this framework, concreteness and imageability ratings are indeed of crucial importance by operationalising the amount of perceptual interaction we have made with objects. Here we tested such an assumption by asking whether visual intuitions about concepts are provided accurately even when direct visual experience is absent. To this aim, we considered concreteness and imageability intuitions in blind people and tested whether these judgments are predicted by Image-based Frequency (IF, i.e. a data-driven estimate approximating the availability of the word referent in the visual environment). Results indicated that IF predicts perceptual intuitions with a larger extent in sighted compared to blind individuals, thus suggesting a role of direct experience in shaping our judgements. However, the effect of IF was significant not only in sighted but also in blind individuals. This indicates that having direct visual experience with objects does not play a critical role in making them concrete and imageable in a person’s intuitions: people do not need visual experience to develop intuition about the availability of things in the external visual environment and use this intuition to inform concreteness/imageability judgments. Our findings fit closely the idea that perceptual judgments are the outcome of introspection/abstraction tasks invoking high-level conceptual knowledge that is not necessarily acquired via direct perceptual experience.",2023-06-04T21:15:49.722159+00:00,"blindness,visual experience,perceptual ratings,grounded cognition,concreteness,imageability",,,"Marco Alessandro Petilli, Marco Marelli",psyarxiv

E00A1-E38-951,Counteracting Deceptive Responding in the Finnish Investigative Instrument of Child Sexual Abuse (FICSA),"Unfounded child sexual abuse (CSA) allegations take investigative resources from real cases and have detrimental consequences for the people involved. The Finnish Investigative Instrument of Child Sexual Abuse (FICSA) supports investigators by estimating the probability of a CSA allegation being true based on the child’s background information. In the current study, we aimed at making FICSA resistant to deception. Two gender-specific questionnaires with FICSA questions and additional “trap” questions were constructed. The trap questions seemed statistically related to CSA but were not. We combined the answers of 278 real victims and 275 16–year-old students, instructed to simulate being CSA victims, to build a Naïve Bayes classifier able to separate the two groups (AUC = 0.91 for boys and AUC = 0.92 for girls). By identifying false allegations early in the investigation, authorities’ resources can be directed towards allegations that are probably true, effectively helping actual CSA victims.",2020-05-30T06:44:02.616314+00:00,"machine learning,child sexual abuse,deception",,,"Jan Antfolk, Alessandro Tadei, Johan Pensar, Pekka Santtila, Juulia Haajanen",psyarxiv

E0175-6EA-2C2,Affective Inhibitory Control and Risk for Internalizing Problems in Adolescents Exposed to Physical and Psychological Abuse. A Population-based Study,"Background. Adolescents’ emotion regulatory capacities may modulate the relationship between childhood maltreatment experiences and psychopathology. Affective inhibitory control constitutes an important part of emotion regulation and involves the ability to regulate automatic or prepotent responses to irrelevant and potentially distracting emotional information. Aims. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of affective inhibitory control in the relationship between exposure to childhood psychological and physical abuse and internalizing problems in adolescence. Method. A nationally representative sample of adolescents (Mage/SD =14/.8) exposed to physical and psychological abuse (N = 1841; male = 964; female = 877) conducted an Emotional Go/No-go task. Participants were presented with angry facial expressions as emotional no-go stimuli in order to examine their ability to inhibit behavioral responses to threatening task-irrelevant stimuli. Results. Affective inhibitory control problems were uniquely related to internalizing problems in girls, but not in boys. Moreover, affective inhibitory control moderated the relationship between exposure to psychological abuse and internalizing problems in girls. We did not observe any relationship between inhibitory control and internalizing problems when neutral faces were presented as task-irrelevant information. Conclusion. Findings suggest that a reduced ability to inhibit threatening, but task-irrelevant, information is related to internalizing problems in adolescent girls exposed to physical and psychological abuse. This highlights the importance of affective inhibitory control as a potential moderating mechanism in individual risk for experiencing internalizing problems in abused adolescent girls.",2020-04-28T17:11:28.443369+00:00,"internalising psychopathology,adolescents,child maltreatment,inhibitory control,emotion regulation",,,"Gertrud Sofie Hafstad, Else-Marie Augusti, Sjur Skjørshammer Sætren",psyarxiv
E0230-A53-7BA,The Relationship Between Childhood Trauma and Adult Neuroticism: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Childhood trauma has been consistently associated with elevated levels of neuroticism in adulthood, a transdiagnostic trait marked by emotional instability, heightened negative affect, and stress sensitivity. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to synthesise evidence examining the association between childhood trauma and adult neuroticism, both overall and by specific trauma subtypes. A comprehensive search of four electronic databases identified 127 eligible studies, encompassing a total of 436,834 individuals. Using a random-effects meta-analysis, results revealed a significant positive association between childhood trauma and adult neuroticism (g = 0.48). Subgroup analyses showed that this association was consistent across all trauma subtypes, including emotional abuse (g = 0.52), emotional neglect (g = 0.40), physical abuse (g = 0.15), physical neglect (g = 0.12), sexual abuse (g = 0.15), unspecified abuse (g = 0.13), and victimisation (g = 0.21), with the exception of unspecified neglect, which showed no significant association. These findings demonstrate a robust relationship between early adversity and neuroticism, regardless of trauma type. Childhood trauma may lead to adaptions that give rise to neuroticism through several psychological mechanisms such as disruptions in attachment and the formation of negative self-beliefs, and neurobiological alterations in stress regulation systems. These results underscore the importance of systemic preventative measures and early intervention strategies that may alleviate the psychological and neurobiological consequences of trauma, with the potential to increase awareness of adaptions such as neuroticism in trauma-exposed populations.",2025-06-23,"Childhood Trauma,Neuroticism",,,"Jayne Morriss, Lyn Ellett, Abigail Pollen, Nur Albaroudi, Amber Davies, Rachel Runton, Shannon Wake, Norma Rosenek",psyarxiv
E013E-A4A-E44,Assessing Mothers' Automatic Affective and Discipline Reactions to Child Behavior in Relation to Child Abuse Risk: A Dual-Processing investigation,"Given the scope and adverse clinical consequences of child abuse, assessment of salient etiological factors can lend critical insights needed for abuse prevention. Increasingly, dual-processing models have been applied to aggression which postulate that parallel automatic and conscious processes can evoke aggressive behavior, implicating both affective and cognitive elements in both routes. Using two samples of mothers (n=110 and n=195), the current investigation considered evidence of the reliability and convergent, concurrent, and construct validity of the new Automatic Parent Emotion Analog Response (APEAR) task relevant to parent-child aggression, contrasted with a self-reported conscious processing measure. Findings provide evidence that affective reactions of both anger and worry relate to child abuse risk and inclination to respond aggressively, and demonstrate how mothers’ automatic reactions relate to both perceived child misbehavior and child dangerous behavior. Current results lend psychometric support for automatic processing in parent-child aggression consistent with other dual-processing theories of aggression.",2020-10-14T19:37:34.518865+00:00,"parent-child aggression,child abuse,physical punishment,social information processing,dual-processing model,analog task,child abuse potential,child maltreatment,corporal punishment,implicit assessment,physical discipline,automatic processing",,,"Andrew Grogan-Kaylor, Christina Rodriguez, Shawna J.

E01F0-6C6-E5C,Preprint: Altered subjective reward valuation among drug-deprived heavy marijuana users: Aversion to uncertainty,"Marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug in the United States and its use is rising. Nonetheless, scientific efforts to clarify the risk for addiction and other harm associated with marijuana use have been lacking. Maladaptive decision-making is a cardinal feature of addiction that is likely to emerge in heavy users. In particular, distorted subjective reward valuation related to homeostatic or allostatic processes has been implicated for many drugs of abuse. Selective changes in responses to uncertainty have been observed in response to intoxication and deprivation from various drugs of abuse. To assess for these potential neuroadaptive changes in reward valuation associated with marijuana deprivation, we examined the subjective value of uncertain and certain rewards among deprived and non-deprived heavy marijuana users in a behavioral economics decision-making task. Deprived users displayed reduced valuation of uncertain rewards, particularly when these rewards were more objectively valuable. This uncertainty aversion increased with increasing quantity of marijuana use. These results suggest comparable decision-making vulnerability from marijuana use as other drugs of abuse, and highlights targets for intervention.",2018-11-19T22:34:09.158905+00:00,"marijuana,uncertainty,reward,drug deprivation,decision-making",,,"Kathryn R.

E0159-9B9-6FD,Does Child Abuse Predict a Population Segment with Large Economic Burden?,"Objectives The enormous societal and individual burden of mental disorders and detrimental health behaviors in the general population is of paramount concern. Many argue that ‘prevention is the best cure’, pushing for the implementation of early (preventive) interventions. A key question regarding this is which population segment to target for screenings, and what information these screening should focus on. Here, in line with previous efforts1, we aimed to identify which population segment holds the majority (≥ 80%) of different economically burdensome outcomes in society, and whether child abuse before age 16 predicts being part of that population segment. Study Design and Methods We used the [masked for review], a [masked for review] epidemiological cohort study including 6,646 adults aged 18-64 at baseline, spanning four time points from 2007 to 2018. We computed cumulative distributions to identify high-cost population segments of economically burdensome outcomes in adulthood (i.e., mental and physical health (behaviors), unemployment and work absenteeism). We examined child abuse as a potential predictor of these segments and investigated the risk of multiple high-cost population segment membership by conducting Poisson regressions. Results A 20% population segment carried between 42% and 100% of economically burdensome outcomes. Being exposed to more child abuse predicted being in a high-cost population segment, albeit with small effect sizes. Being exposed to more child abuse also predicted belonging to multiple high-cost population segments across different economically burdensome outcomes. Conclusions Our findings have implications for policy makers: emphasis should be placed on prevention aimed at identifying potential members of multiple high-cost population segments.",2024-08-20T09:11:24.274686+00:00,,,,"Annemarie Luik, Geertjan Overbeek, Jana Runze, Margreet ten Have",psyarxiv
E0120-701-30E,Adverse Childhood Experiences and Sleep in Adult Women: A Dimensional Approach,"Women are disproportionately affected by poor sleep, both in terms of how much sleep they get (quantity) and how disturbed that sleep is (quality). One relatively unexplored association with poor sleep is adverse childhood experiences, which also disproportionately affect women. How childhood adversity affects sleep in adult women is not well understood, partly because of opacity in the way prior research considers different types of adversity. Prior research has emphasized cumulative approaches, treating all adverse experiences as equivalent and overlooking how different adversities may manifest in adult health problems. We investigated how adversity differentially contributed to sleep issues in a sample of treatment-seeking women (N=329), utilizing both cumulative and person-centered, dimensional analytic approaches. Latent class analysis revealed four distinct adversity profiles: ‘emotional/physical abuse’, ‘household dysfunction’, ‘high ACEs’, and ‘low ACEs’. Sleep symptom analysis identified two subgroups: high and low sleep issues. Women classified within the abuse-related and high-ACE subgroups reported worse sleep, while those in the abuse profile did so even when their total cumulative adversity scores did not reach conventional clinical thresholds. These findings suggest that specific patterns of childhood adversity—particularly abuse—uniquely contribute to adult sleep issues among women and can be missed using only cumulative scoring methods. This study underscores the importance of dimensional, subtype-focused approaches to ACE research and highlights the enduring impact of childhood adversity on women’s lifelong sleep health.",2025-07-22,"childhood adversity,latent class analysis,sleep,women",,,"Sarah Tashjian, Geraldine O'Bryan",psyarxiv

E0062-E56-BC5,A Qualitative Analysis of Gaslighting in Romantic Relationships,"Gaslighting is an understudied form of abuse wherein a sane and rational survivor is convinced of their own epistemic incompetence on false pretenses by a perpetrator. The current study aimed to characterize the features of gaslighting as well as test and verify common claims about gaslighting. We recruited participants (N = 65) who self-identified as having experienced gaslighting in romantic relationships to fill out a qualitative survey wherein they described instances of gaslighting, features of their relationships, and the consequences of gaslighting on their mental health. The age of participants in this study ranged from 18-69 (M = 29), most participants identified as female (48), and heterosexual (43). Gaslighting occurs within relationships that are typified by a combination of affectionate and abusive behaviors extended over the course of a relationship. Gaslighting victimization was associated with a diminished sense of self, mistrust of others, and on occasion, post-traumatic growth. Those who recovered from gaslighting often emphasized the importance of separation from the perpetrator, prioritization of healthier relationships, and engaging in meaningful and re-embodying activities. This study provides a basis for further research into gaslighting and recovery from gaslighting, which will contribute to prevention of and treatment for this type of abuse.",2022-06-04T16:43:02.057452+00:00,"intimate partner violence,gaslighting,relationships,epistemic abuse",,,"Sherry Li, Suzanne Wood, Willis Klein",psyarxiv

Results showed stability of the scale across male and female participants, and demonstrated correlates with convergent scales (e.g., the ACEs assessment) and criterion variables (e.g., depressive symptoms). These findings present a positive step forward for more comprehensive assessment of childhood experiences which can be used alongside the frequently used ACEs assessment, potentially complementing clinical assessment in this area.",2023-11-09T16:50:43.652076+00:00,"childhood abuse,mental health,trauma,family toxicity",,,"Stephen D.

Owing to recent legislative developments in the United Kingdom that criminalize coercive control under the Domestic Abuse Act (2021), this study offers a timely investigation into the mechanisms of sexual coercion in domestic abuse across sexual abuse and coercive control. We used moderation analysis (n = 405) to investigate whether sexual coercion proclivity was predicted by facets of atypical sexuality (non-clinical elevated levels of sex drive, sexual sadism, and sexual masochism), and whether this relationship was moderated by psychopathic personality traits specifically the factor one components, which encompasses interpersonal and affective characteristics). Psychopathic personality traits significantly moderated the positive association between sex drive and sexual coercion proclivity, and between sexual sadism and sexual coercion proclivity in males (but not females), but psychopathic personality traits had no such moderating effect in the sexual masochism model.

E00B0-71D-492,Associations of Exposure Frequencies of Single Adverse Childhood Experiences with Psychological Distress: Evidence from a Cohort Study among Emerging Adults,"Background: Adverse childhood experiences (ACE) are significant transdiagnostic risk factors for impaired psychosocial functioning and mental health conditions throughout life. Most research on ACEs has used composite scores, which precludes specific conclusions about the impact of individual adverse experiences and their frequency of occurrence. Objective: To investigate the association between exposure frequencies of single adverse experiences with psychological distress among emerging adults. Participants and Setting: A total of 2528 emerging Swiss adults aged 18 to 22 years (mean age 19.3) from a random population sample participating in the first wave of a cohort study. Methods: ACE measures were 39 specific experiences for neglect (emotional, physical), abuse (emotional, physical, sexual), witnessing violence, peer maltreatment and parental psychopathology. ANOVA models were used to estimate the associations of exposure frequencies for each adverse experience with psychological distress. Results: Single adverse childhood experiences were strongly associated with psychological distress in emerging adulthood, with considerable differences across experiences and their exposure frequencies. Physical and sexual abuse experiences were associated with psychological distress across all exposure frequencies, including if experienced only rarely. Emotional abuse, emotional neglect and verbal abuse by peers experiences showed associations with psychological distress mainly at higher exposure frequencies. Conclusions: The severe impact of adverse childhood experiences on the mental health of emerging adults varies greatly depending on the specific adverse experience and how often a person had to endure them. Our research underscores the value of analyzing the impact of single adversities and their exposure frequencies alongside dimensional approaches in ACE research.

A cross-sectional study was performed, using a self-reporting, anonymous, questionnaire. Data were analyzed by frequency/percentages, using SPSS software. A total of 234 individuals of various gender identity (male, female, non-binary, demigirl, agender, gender fluid) participated in the study (Mage = 22.52, SD = 6.65). The results indicate a 39.7% (N = 93) prevalence of CSA in the tested Polish population. Of the total sample, 13.2% knew other 3 or more individuals who suffered from CSA, 14.5% knew other 2 persons, and 26.1% knew one individual. Of the abused participants, 36.5% was of intra- and extrafamilial (51.6%) nature, whilst 11.8% experienced both. The mean age the first abuse occurred was 9.20 (SD = 3.43). The duration of CSA varied: 2 weeks up to 8 years. The most common type of violation was fondling (91.4%) and other sexual activities, excluding penetration (62.4%). All of the CSA victims experienced at least 2 types of sexual violation. The overall prevalence found in the current study was higher than expected, suggesting that victims may currently be more likely to self-report on CSA experiences, as majority of respondents, more than 80%, are in the 18-30 age group. It is suggested that there is a greater need for understating the scale of CSA in Poland and for inclusion of other gender identities in the research on this topic.",2020-08-31T19:12:33.901942+00:00,"child sexual abuse (csa) in poland,csa prevalence,csa characteristics",,,Milena Agnieszka Guziak,psyarxiv
E0250-B1A-56A,The effect of intrinsic image memorability on recollection and familiarity,"Many photographs of real-life scenes are very consistently remembered or forgotten by most people, making these images intrinsically memorable or forgettable. Although machine vision algorithms can predict a given image’s memorability very well, nothing is known about the subjective quality of these memories: are memorable images recognized based on strong feelings of familiarity or on recollection of episodic details? We tested people’s recognition memory for memorable and forgettable scenes selected from image memorability databases, which contain memorability scores for each image, based on large-scale recognition memory experiments. Specifically, we tested the effect of intrinsic memorability on recollection and familiarity using cognitive computational models based on Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROCs; Experiment 1 and 2) and on remember/know (R/K) judgments (Experiment 2). The ROC data of experiment 1 indicated that image memorability boosted memory strength, but did not find a specific effect on recollection or familiarity. By contrast, ROC data from Experiment 2, which was designed to facilitate encoding and, in turn, recollection, found more evidence for a specific effect of image memorability on recollection. Moreover, R/K judgments showed that, on average, memorability boosts recollection rather than familiarity. However, we also found a large degree of variability in these ratings across individual images: some images actually achieved high recognition rates by exclusively boosting familiarity rather than recollection. Together, these results show that current machine vision algorithms that can predict an image’s intrinsic memorability in terms of hit rates fall short of describing the subjective quality of human memories.",2019-09-18T12:15:07.846266+00:00,,,,"Niko Busch, Nico Broers",psyarxiv

Given Health Influencers' considerable social reach and mounting concern that certain types of Instagram content can negatively affect young people’s mental health and body image, it is important to assess the social costs of their posting habits. While empirical research has identified types of posts that contribute to body image issues (e.g., selfies exhibiting naked body parts), research on the prevalence of these posts in health messages on Instagram is more limited. To this end, we analyzed the most frequently used hashtags of 784 Health Influencers with ten-thousand or more followers and fit an unsupervised topic model to over 285,000 of their posts. This analysis revealed that a majority of health and wellness content on Instagram is related to four themes: Cosmetics and Appearance, Self-promotion, Fitness, and General Wellness. Furthermore, while many posts appear to promote health habits (e.g., vegan food recipes or posts of inspiration and encouragement), a substantial number of images contain content previous research has suggested can lead to body-image and self-esteem issues (e.g., photos promoting thin-body ideals). Future work will package this model as a web application that informs users of their own potentially harmful posting behaviors.",2020-11-29T21:10:35.735728+00:00,"instagram,body image,topic modeling,mental health",,,"Chaewon Michelle Bak, J.

E00DD-007-4E0,Average faces: How does the averaging process change faces physically and perceptually,"Average faces have been used frequently in face recognition studies, either as a theoretical concept (e.g., face norm) or as a tool to manipulate facial attributes (e.g., modifying identity strength). Nonetheless, how the face averaging process— the creation of average faces using an increasing number of faces —changes the resulting averaged faces and our ability to differentiate between them remains to be elucidated. Here we addressed these questions by combining 3D-face averaging, eye-movement tracking, and the computation of image-based face similarity. Participants judged whether two average faces showed the same person while we systematically increased their average level (i.e., number of faces being averaged). Our results showed, with increasing averaging, both a nonlinear increase of the computational similarity between the resulting average faces and a nonlinear decrease of face discrimination performance. Participants’ performance dropped from near-ceiling level when two different faces had been averaged together to chance level when 80 faces were mixed. We also found a nonlinear relationship between face similarity and face discrimination performance, which was fitted nicely with an exponential function. Furthermore, when the comparison task became more challenging, participants performed more fixations onto the faces. Nonetheless, the distribution of fixations across facial features (eyes, nose, mouth, and the center area of a face) remained unchanged. These results not only set new constraints on the theoretical characterization of the average face and its role in establishing face norms but also offer practical guidance for creating approximated face norms to manipulate face identity.",2021-02-22T13:28:09.687430+00:00,,,,"Isabelle Bülthoff, Mintao Zhao",psyarxiv
E0083-7F4-105,Automated Generation of Perceptually-Uniform Circular Spaces for Novel Naturalistic Shapes,"Shape processing holds a crucial role in higher-level visual functions, such as object recognition. Previous efforts to explore high-level vision, independent of shape influence, involved meticulous measurements to control for perceptual shape similarity across distinct stimulus sets. However, there is a compelling need for a more efficient approach to automatically synthesize perceptually uniform spaces of novel shapes. In this pursuit, we present an image-based method that autonomously generates numerous perceptually uniform and circular shape sets, eliminating the need for extensive psychophysical measurements. Our method employs a search for circular shape sets correlated with ShapeComp, an image-computable shape similarity metric based on over 100 descriptors, highly predictive of human shape similarity. Using multi-arrangement methods, we demonstrate that predicted human similarity arrangements of shape sets defined as circular and uniformly spaced by ShapeComp, align with human shape similarity judgments and approximate circularity. Notably, shape sets chosen for uniformity and circularity in alternative shape spaces (e.g., Generative Adversarial Networks or Radial Frequency patterns), but not meeting these criteria in ShapeComp, did not necessarily register as perceptually uniform and circular. Therefore, leveraging ShapeComp, we introduce an automated method for generating extensive sets of perceptually uniform and circular shape spaces. We provide five newly validated circular shape sets derived from intricate naturalistic shapes, along with MATLAB code facilitating the creation of a limitless number of such sets. This advancement empowers cognitive scientists to construct large sets of perceptually uniform stimuli, allowing for a nuanced exploration of the impact of higher-level factors on object perception.",2025-02-28T10:10:42.925989+00:00,"computational modelling,object perception,visual similarity,shape similarity,perceptually uniform,circular shape space",,,"Ana Belen Carbajal Chavez, Johan Wagemans, Eline Van Geert, Yaniv Morgenstern",psyarxiv
E0220-823-36D,Using AI to Generate Affective Images: Methodology and Initial Library,"This project aims to advance affective science by leveraging generative artificial intelligence (AI) to create a publicly accessible database of affect induction images: Library of AI-Generated Affective Images (LAI-GAI). Current limitations in image-based research include weak to moderate emotional elicitation effects, limited image diversity, and minimal cultural tailoring of images. First, we built a pipeline for utilizing generative AI to develop affective images that capitalized on existing datasets and emotion definitions. Second, using the pipeline, we developed a library of images (n = 480) and their descriptions across 12 discrete emotion categories. The project employed a human-in-the-loop approach to refine and validate these stimuli, ensuring their effectiveness and cultural relevance. We validated the library through three international studies involving 1,611 participants from 44 countries, who rated three types of images: (1) images from existing affective databases, (2) AI-generated images without cultural adjustments, and (3) AI-generated images adjusted to specific cultural contexts. The AI-generated images were as effective in eliciting affective responses as the images from existing affective databases. The culturally adjusted images were slightly more effective in eliciting targeted affective responses compared to their counterparts unadjusted to participants' cultural context. Furthermore, we calculated the smallest effect sizes of interest for affect induction research (d’s from 0.06 to 0.31). This work demonstrates that researchers can now generate high-quality affect induction stimuli cost-effectively and at scale, and tailor them to diverse contexts—overcoming longstanding barriers and laying the groundwork for future AI-driven methodologies in affective science.",2025-06-25,"Affect,Affect Induction Procedures,Emotion,Generative Artificial Intelligence,Image Database",,,"James Gross, Rafał Jończyk, Shan, Eli Rice, Dominika Kunc, Rohmotul Islam, Arooj Najmussaqib, Szymon Jęśko-Białek, Patryk Maciejewski, Maciej Kłoskowski, Nicholas A.

E01A3-4B1-409,Intergenerational Incest Aversion,"The biological costs of inbreeding are expected to have shaped human incest aversion. These costs depend on biological sex, relatedness, and age. Whereas previous studies have focused on investigating how these factors modulate incest aversion in siblings and cousins—family members of the same generation—here we examined relatives of different generations. In a population-based sample, 2,499 respondents reported reactions to imagined sexual behaviors with either a biological child or parent, a niece/nephew or aunt/uncle, or a stepchild or stepparent; these responses were compared to reactions to imagined sexual behaviors involving a friend’s child or parent. Replicating prior results, women report stronger incest aversions than do men. We extend previous findings by showing that incest aversions tended to be stronger between close (vs. more distant) intergenerational relatives. Indeed, for biological relatives, decreased degree of relatedness was associated with decreased incest aversion, and for biological relatives, the certainty in relatedness was also positively associated with incest aversion. As expected, age modulated sexual aversion for unrelated, but not related, target individuals. Sexual aversions toward step-relatives did not differ from sexual aversions to biological relatives.",2018-06-10T18:04:13.047588+00:00,"sexual abuse,sexual arousal,incest aversion,disgust,inbreeding",,,"Michael Seto, Jan Antfolk, Paula Kresanov, Pekka Santtila, Debra Lieberman, Jennifer Kotler",psyarxiv
E00D0-770-B28,Preprint: How bad could it be? Alcohol dampens stress responses to uncertain intensity threat,"Stress response dampening (SRD) is an important motive for alcohol use. However, alcohol SRD is observed inconsistently in and out of the laboratory. This has raised questions about precise mechanisms and boundary conditions required for stress reduction from alcohol. Emerging evidence indicates that alcohol SRD may be observed selectively during uncertain but not certain threats. We measured stress response via potentiation of participants’ defensive startle reflex to threat of shock in blocks of certain (low and high) intensity and uncertain intensity shock. We manipulated 92 participants’ blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) across a broad range (0.00%-0.12%). Increasing BACs were associated with linearly decreasing startle potentiation and self-reported anxiety. This alcohol SRD effect was greater during uncertain than certain threat. Furthermore, we identified binge drinking as a moderator of alcohol SRD. More broadly, these results suggest that distinct mechanisms are involved in response to uncertain vs. certain intensity threats.",2018-11-19T22:07:12.267718+00:00,"startle reflex,stress reactions,drug/substance abuse,emotions",,,"Daniel E.

As corroborating evidence largely rests on samples of convicted men, we conducted online surveys among German-speaking (Study 1, N = 199) and English-speaking men (Study 2, N = 632), specifically targeting community members with pedohebephilic or teleiophilic interests. Although we detected theoretically meaningful sexual interest patterns in an embedded viewing time task, we could not detect expected neurodevelopmental differences between teleiophilic and pedohebephilic men in either of the two studies. Strikingly, pedohebephilic men who reported convictions for sexual offences emerged as smaller and less intelligent than pedohebephilic men without convictions in Study 2. While elucidating possible third variable confounds, results have to be interpreted cautiously because of the methodological problems inherent to non-matched case control designs.",2021-11-11T13:46:13.311859+00:00,"etiology,neurobiology,hebephilia,neurodevelopment,child sexual abuse,pedophilia",,,"Alexander F.

E00A7-ED0-4C8,Financial Exploitation of Older Adults in the United States: A Pre-COVID-19 Systematic Scoping Review,"Abstract Background and Objectives: The present study is a systematic scoping review to determine the extent and nature of the peer-reviewed research concerning financial exploitation of older adults in the United States (U.S.). The rising population of older adults means financial exploitation is a major challenge that will grow in the future. Recent estimates suggest that older adults already lose billions of dollars in personal wealth every year. Research Design and Methods: The review was structured by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocol (PRISMAP). Five academic databases - Web of Science, EBSCO, PyscINFO, Social Services Abstracts, and PubMed - as well as Google Scholar were searched using variations of the phrases “financial exploitation AND older adults”. Results: Fifty-two peer-reviewed papers were identified and categorized into nine subject areas: (1) profiles of older adults who experienced financial exploitation, (2) measuring financial exploitation, (3) profiles of perpetrators, (4) impacts of financial exploitation, (5) prevalence estimates, (6) racial, ethnic, and cultural differences, (7) conceptual models and frameworks, (8) stakeholders’ perceptions, and (9) legal and non-legal services. Discussion and Implications: The review found a limited number of peer-reviewed papers focused on financial exploitation of older adults (n=52), which were spread across a large number of subject areas (n=9). Yet critical gaps remained in the literature, including a lack of research about the effectiveness of legal and non-legal services, the potential role of systemic racism, and financial exploitation via technology.",2022-12-31T19:13:52.454529+00:00,"financial abuse,financial exploitation,older adults,legal issues",,,"Daniel Velez-Ortiz, Mathew Andres, Christopher Larrison, Gaurav R.

E00BA-60F-8D3,‘Is there a relationship between Childhood Sexual Abuse (CSA) and depersonalisation and derealisation experiences in adulthood?: A Systematic Review’,"Background Dissociation occurs in “fight or flight” situations when someone is feeling overwhelmed. Depersonalisation/Derealisation disorder (DPDRD) is a type of dissociation that involves feeling removed from one’s self and reality. DPDRD has been linked with interpersonal abuse but research is less clear on the role childhood sexual abuse (CSA) has on this dissociative experience. Method Following a systematic review protocol, four electronic database searches, a citation search and grey literature search were conducted. Overall, 10 papers assessing links between CSA and depersonalisation and derealisation were identified and quality assessed. A textual narrative synthesis was conducted to extract results from each study and identify patterns within the data. Results The synthesis indicated that samples were predominantly female and White/Caucasian. Over half the papers identified an association between CSA and depersonalisation/derealisation although these relationships were mainly weak or moderate. Further analysis suggested that methodological issues with sampling may have caused some bias. Conclusion Tentative links do exist between CSA and depersonalisation/derealisation, but methodological limitations within the studies, suggest possible biased results. Therefore, this review highlights a need for further research addressing these issues, to produce conclusive results.

E0166-7DE-83D,Usability and Effectiveness of the Finnish Investigative Instrument of Child Sexual Abuse,"The Finnish Investigative Instrument of Child Sexual Abuse (FICSA) is a computerized tool that uses Bayesian statistics to estimate the probability that a reported child sex abuse (CSA) is true or false based on population level information regarding the correlates of CSA. FICSA can be used to assist decision-making in investigations of CSA. We compared forensic experts’ and students’ ability to use FICSA and whether its use affected the estimates of the probability of CSA in mock-scenarios. The use of FICSA was compared to only having access to the empirical information about CSA risk and protective factors, which FICSA is based on, and to unassisted decision-making. The 54 participants analyzed two scenarios of possible CSA and estimated the probability of the CSA allegation being true. The results show that participants using FICSA were prone to make technical mistakes that affect the correctness of the probability estimation. The performance of experts and students was equivalent in all the conditions, but in the group using FICSA, where experts tended to deviate from the probability provided by FICSA more than students. Having only access to empirical information did not improve estimates compared to unassisted decision-making. Both students and experts tended to adjust the estimates provided by FICSA downwards, that is, to decrease the probability of abuse. We conclude that FICSA can assist investigators to correctly integrate evidence and calculate probabilities but that proper training is required.",2018-05-05T08:03:28.558409+00:00,,,,"Pekka Santtila, Alessandro Tadei, Jan Antfolk",psyarxiv

E024F-72B-F18,Surprising gender biases in GPT,"We present seven experiments exploring gender biases in GPT. Initially, GPT was asked to generate demographics of a potential writer of twenty phrases containing feminine stereotypes and twenty with masculine stereotypes. Results show a strong asymmetry, with stereotypically masculine sentences attributed to a female more often than vice versa. For example, the sentence “I love playing fotbal! Im practicing with my cosin Michael” was constantly assigned by ChatGPT to a female writer. This phenomenon likely reflects that while initiatives to integrate women in traditionally masculine roles have gained momentum, the reverse movement remains relatively underdeveloped. Subsequent experiments investigate the same issue in high-stakes moral dilemmas. GPT-4 finds it more appropriate to abuse a man to prevent a nuclear apocalypse than to abuse a woman. This bias extends to other forms of violence central to the gender parity debate (abuse), but not to those less central (torture). Moreover, this bias increases in cases of mixed-sex violence for the greater good: GPT-4 agrees with a woman using violence against a man to prevent a nuclear apocalypse but disagrees with a man using violence against a woman for the same purpose. Finally, these biases are implicit, as they do not emerge when GPT-4 is directly asked to rank moral violations. These results highlight the necessity of carefully managing inclusivity efforts to prevent unintended discrimination.",2024-07-08T10:44:02.081380+00:00,"artificial intelligence,gender roles,large language models,chatgpt,gender bias,ai,moral dilemmas,gpt,inclusivity,generative ai",,,"Raluca Alexandra Fulgu, Valerio Capraro",psyarxiv

E021A-6B7-DD5,Perceptions of Alcohol Use in Tanzanian Society,"Background: Alcohol is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide, with 4-6% of deaths annually the result of harmful alcohol use. Alcohol’s effect on health outcomes involves societal and individual factors including culture, consumption patterns, familial factors, etc. Rates of alcohol abuse in Moshi are ~2.5x higher than the Tanzanian average. We sought to qualitatively assess the perceptions of alcohol use in Moshi, Tanzania including availability, consumption patterns, abuse, and treatment in order to identify potential targets for policy or behavioral intervention. Methods: Focus groups were conducted using a convenience sample of injury patients, their families, and community advisory board(CAB) members. Discussions, led by trained, bilingual research nurses, were audiotaped, transcribed, and translated for formal qualitative analysis. Transcriptions were then analyzed in parallel using an inductive thematic content analysis approach. Resultant themes were then reanalyzed to ensure internal homogeneity and external heterogeneity. Results: 14 focus group discussions, with a total of 104 participants (40 patients, 50 family members, 14 CAB members) were conducted. Major themes resulting from the analysis including 1) Early/repeated exposure leading to view of alcohol as “just another drink”, 2) Moderate use as a social norm with positive attributes, 3) Complications of overconsumption and abuse (including drunk driving) are widely stigmatized, and 4) Limited knowledge and availability regarding alcohol treatment or cessation and treatment. Conclusions: The burden of alcohol-related health outcomes seen at KCMC is the result of a complex interaction of social, individual, and cultural factors. Drinking culture and context result in ubiquitous exposure from an early age and normalization of alcohol-related behaviors. Despite this, there is strong stigma towards complications stemming from alcohol abuse.

E00BE-FB4-549,Differential effects of childhood maltreatment types and timing on psychopathology in formerly out-of-home placed young adults,"Childhood maltreatment (CM) increases the risk of psychopathology. Besides CM types and severity, the timing of exposure is an important modulating factor in this association, as childhood and adolescence comprise sensitive developmental periods for brain maturation and socio-emotional development. Nevertheless, previously reported associations between the severity of subtypes and timing of CM and psychopathology have been heterogeneous and have hardly considered vulnerable groups broadly exposed to CM, such as out-of-home-placed youth. Thus, we investigated the association between CM types and timing and psychopathology in a sample of formerly out-of-home placed young adults (N = 185; 32% women, age mean = 26.38, SD = 3.49 years). CM was assessed using the Maltreatment of Abuse Chronology of Exposure Scale and general, internalizing and, externalizing problems were assessed using the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment. We employed conditional random forest regression to estimate the importance of CM types (abuse, neglect, peer victimization, and sexual abuse), timings (ages 3–18) as well as CM severity, multiplicity, and duration on adult general, internalizing, and externalizing problems. We validated the results using diagnoses of mental disorders assessed in clinical interviews, which were classified under general, internalizing, and externalizing clusters based on the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology model. We found that CM severity and multiplicity were stronger predictors of internalizing problems than timing-specific effects of CM types. Abuse in early childhood and peer violence in late adolescence were stronger predictors of externalizing problems compared to global CM measures. Our findings highlight the importance of considering CM type and timing when testing CM-associated risks for psychopathology. This might further be valuable in therapeutic settings to guide maltreatment-informed interventions. Reducing violent caregiving environments in early childhood and preventing peer victimization in adolescence may be especially important in counteracting CM-associated risks of externalizing behaviors.",2024-10-17T16:38:15.020905+00:00,"type of childhood maltreatment,childhood maltreatment,timing of childhood maltreatment,random forest regression",,,"Nils Jenkel, Inga Schalinski, Cyril Boonmann, Marc Schmid, Jörg Fegert, Süheyla Seker, Delfine d'Huart, David Bürgin, Vera Clemens, Maria Meier",psyarxiv

Extrapolating these findings to England and Wales, the intervention's yearly cost would be £2,176,438 while the savings, or net economic benefit, would be £18,372,615.

While there is an increasing amount of research into this topic, particularly in relation to the stigmatisation of minor-attracted persons (MAPs) and the barriers to them seeking help, there is currently no theoretical framework within which to consider this prevention landscape. In this paper, we suggest that an extension of Göbbels, Ward, and Willis’ (2012) integrative theory of desistance from sexual offending could fill this gap in the literature.

E0186-32F-862,The Rating of Emotional Abuse in Childhood (REACH) Questionnaire: A new self-report measure assessing history of childhood emotional abuse,"BACKGROUND: History of childhood emotional abuse (CEA) is prevalent among adults with affective disorders; therefore, a comprehensive measure of it is vital. The Rating of Emotional Abuse in Childhood Questionnaire (REACH) was developed to assess history of CEA in relation to threat, ignoring, humiliation/denigration, scapegoating, antipathy, and overcontrol/conditionality in a single measure. This paper investigated the psychometric properties of REACH in a community sample and proposes values for identifying individuals with clinically significant history of CEA. METHOD: A convenient sample of N = 483 adults (Female, 78.3 %) was recruited to complete questionnaires that included the REACH alongside measures of mental health, insecure attachment, emotion regulation, and childhood abuse. A subset of participants (n = 198) completed the REACH 7 days later. RESULTS: Factor analysis indicated a 2-factor model provided a good fit, with factors consistent with direct threat and covert categorisation of CEA. A total scale score of CEA was also recommended. The direct threat, covert, and total scales demonstrated strong psychometric properties with high internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and convergent validity, while our cutoff value for identifying significant history of CEA demonstrated good discriminant validity. LIMITATIONS: Convenient community sampling was used whereby most participants were female, thus the results may not generalise to other populations. CONCLUSIONS: The results support REACH as a valid measure and suggest history of CEA should be measured in relation to direct threat and covert CEA as they represent unique dimensions of CEA even though they often co-occur.",2023-03-23T17:00:44.055380+00:00,"psychometric properties,depression,childhood emotional abuse,factor analysis,mental health,anxiety",,,"Vilas Sawrikar, Karen Goodall",psyarxiv

Furthermore, the localization of somatization associated with childhood maltreatment and its subtypes is unknown. This large-scale experience sampling study uses body maps to examine the relationships between childhood maltreatment, its subtypes, and the intensity and location of negative somatic sensations in daily life. Participants (N=2,234; 33% female, 67% male) were part of MyBPLab 2.0, a large study conducted using a bespoke mobile phone application. Four categories of childhood maltreatment (emotional abuse, physical abuse, physical neglect, and emotional neglect) were measured using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. Using gender-matched human silhouettes, participants indicated the location and intensity of feelings of negative activation in the body. Childhood maltreatment generally and its four measured subtypes were all positively associated with heightened negative activation on both the front and back body maps. For females, total childhood maltreatment was linked to negative activation in the abdomen and lower back, while for males, the association was localized to the lower back. Similarly, each of the four subscales had localized associations with negative activation in the abdomen and lower back in females, and lower back in males, except for emotional abuse, which was also associated with negative activation in the abdomen in males. These associations likely reflect increased somatization in individuals exposed to childhood maltreatment, suggesting a role for psychotherapeutic interventions in alleviating associated distress.",2023-09-27T02:35:54.786737+00:00,"early adversity,somatic symptoms,body maps,childhood maltreatment,somatization,adverse childhood experiences",,,"Sara Verosky, wendy berry mendes, Ethan G.

E01A5-071-F26,Modular Maximization Theory: A Functional Account of Economic Behavior in Laboratory Animal Models with Applications to Drug-Seeking Behavior,"Substance abuse research depends on precise and sensitive assessments of reinforcer efficacy in animal models. However, conventional methods often lack theoretical rigor and specificity to support these assessments. To address these gaps, the Modular Maximization Theory (MMT) is introduced as a comprehensive framework for understanding instrumental behavior. Like earlier maximization theories, MMT posits that behavior is distributed across alternatives to maximize utility over time. This concept is structured through five foundational postulates that define alternative actions and rules for choosing between them as budget constraints and utility functions. A key innovation of MMT is its incorporation of reinforcer utilization—encompassing both consummatory and post-consummatory activities—into the budget-constraint function. A model of ratio-schedule performance is developed under the assumption that utilization is proportional to demand, with utility represented as an additive power function of reinforcer magnitude. This model, termed PURSPU (Proportional Utilization, Ratio Schedule, Power Utility), effectively explains how reinforcer magnitude, response effort, non-contingent reinforcement, and income influence demand curves, behavior-output functions, dose-response relationships, and progressive-ratio breakpoints, while accounting for rate-dependent effects. The model also offers novel insights into choice behavior, including concurrent-schedule performance, income dependency, and delay discounting, as well as post-reinforcement pauses and run rates. Variations in budget constraints and utility functions are proposed as alternative models. Potential theoretical advancements, more targeted assessments of drug abuse liability, and the broader role of MMT in understanding human drug abuse are explored.",2024-09-19T19:46:34.312713+00:00,"operant performance,behavioral economics,animal models,reinforcer efficacy,drug abuse liability",,,"Brissa Gutierrez, Adeline Hibshman, Federico Sanabria, Cristina Santos, Matthew Gildea",psyarxiv
E024C-1B0-8CA,"Dispositional disinhibition and alcohol use disorders: Personality, risk appraisal and problematic alcohol consumption","Background: The relationship between psychopathic personality and problematic alcohol consumption could be important for understanding risk and potential interventions. This existing work on psychopathy and alcohol abuse is typically conducted in criminal and hospitalised populations and little attention has been paid to investigating the general populations’ psychopathic personality and problematic consumption of alcohol. The psychopathy-focused Triarchic Psychopathy Measure (TriPM) and the more general Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory of personality (RST) focus on individual differences related to low self-control and sensation seeking, and could relate to problematic alcohol consumption in non-forensic samples. The current study brings together RST and psychopathic personality traits to predict alcohol use disorders. We hypothesise that impulsivity and anxiety predict problematic alcohol consumption and related risk appraisal. Methods: We analysed data from a sample of 349 general population participants who had completed measures of the TriPM, RST, alcohol use disorders (AUDIT) and their perceived negative outcomes of high risk behaviour with the Cognitive Appraisal of Risky Events (CARE) measure. Results: We find some evidence that TriPM’s disinhibition and RST’s anxious personality traits relate to AUDIT scores. We find limited evidence that personality traits predict the negative appraisal of risky events, but alcohol use was related to increased perceptions of the negative outcomes of alcohol consumption. Conclusions: Overall this study shows that individual differences do relate to problematic alcohol consumption but not the appraisal of risks related to alcohol consumption. This has implications for the structuring of intervention for those at risk of problematic consumption of alcohol.",2018-05-18T11:15:02.484671+00:00,"alcohol abuse,reinforcement sensitivity theory,risk evaluation,psychopathy,personality",,,"Liam Satchell, Charlotte A.

E01F1-E56-8F9,"The CARA (Cautioning and Relationship Abuse) Service Theory of change, impact evaluation and economic benefits study report","This project found that the CARA (Cautioning and Relationship Abuse) Service has a significant impact on recidivism. On average, the CARA Service reduced offences by 81% in the first six months and by 56% in the first 12 months for West Midlands. CARA reduced offences by 39% in the first six months and by 41% in the first 12 months for Hampshire. The economic benefits study suggests that the economic benefits of introducing a CARA Service into a police force area are significant, even using conservative estimates. For West Midlands, the net benefit of the CARA Service would be £152,775.94 in a period of six months and £156,581 annually. For Hampshire, the net benefit is estimated to be £596,066 in the first six months and £780,864.40 annually. For West Midlands, the benefit-cost ratio is equal to 2.75, meaning that for each pound invested in a CARA project 2.75 pounds are gained. For Hampshire, the benefit-cost ratio is equal to 11.10, meaning that for each pound invested in a CARA project 11.10 pounds are gained. These numbers are conservative estimates of the true impact of CARA effect (i.e., the actual benefit of CARA could be greater).",2022-01-18T18:47:04.295537+00:00,"domestic violence,interpersonal violence,domestic abuse,interventions,perpetrator,cara",,,"Siddhartha Bandyopadhyay, Eddie Kane, Christine Christie, Yiannis Karavias, Caroline Bradbury-Jones, Heather D Flowe, Julie Taylor",psyarxiv

In two studies (NStudy 1 = 3158; NStudy 2 = 305) using an integrative methodology considering recent methodological discussions, we found that most participants reported to believe in repressed memory. They also appeared to think of an unconscious mechanism when reporting beliefs in repression, whereas they were more sceptical about deliberate memory suppression. Participants with no memory of childhood abuse expressed more scepticism about unconscious and deliberate mechanisms than those with such memories (Study 1). The order in which the items were presented was not associated with beliefs in the different statements (Study 2).

E0111-D74-1C1,Mixed-Method Examination of Early Maladaptive Schemas and Coping Among Children at a Child Advocacy Center,"Objective: The present study examined: (1) the presence of early maladaptive schemas and coping responses in children who have experienced maltreatment, (2) the relationship between early maladaptive schemas and coping responses, and (3) how qualitative findings compare to previous theoretical structures in quantitative studies. Method: There were 100 participants (Mage = 10.72 years, SD = 3.35; 64 girls, 30 boys, 6 transgender/nonbinary), with 70% identifying as White. Data were collected in collaboration with a community child advocacy center through forensic interviews in cases of reported child abuse. Early maladaptive schemas were assessed using an adapted version of Dusseldorf Illustrated Schema Questionnaire for Children. Coping responses were assessed using the COPE Inventory. Information about individual and abuse factors were gathered from case reports. Child advocacy center staff completed the measures based on information obtained during forensic interviews. Results: All assessed early maladaptive schemas were endorsed in this sample; children reported an ability to adapt through the use of socially-supported and self-sufficient coping responses. Hierarchical cluster analysis examining word similarity within coded texts demonstrated that subjugation and self-sacrifice were most strongly related. Conclusion: This mixed-method study integrating children’s voices contributes a new perspective on early maladaptive schemas and coping responses that can provide education to multidisciplinary teams involved in forensic interviews. However, limits to generalizability must be considered given that the sample was derived from one region in the U.S. Midwest.",2024-07-23T20:56:41.579393+00:00,"child advocacy,forensic evaluation,schema,child abuse,coping behavior",,,"Viann N Nguyen-Feng, Linda Zheng",psyarxiv
E01A4-6BF-646,"Adverse Childhood Experiences among Kenyan Adolescents: Psychometric Properties, Prevalence Rates and Correlates","Background: Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) have been consistently linked to poor mental health outcomes, yet research on their impact in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) resource settings of Africa, remain relatively unexplored. In Kenya, where childhood adversity is widespread, there is a critical need to examine the validity of ACE measures and their associations with mental ill health.
Objective: This study aimed to validate the ACE questionnaire in a Kenyan adolescent sample and assess its associations with symptoms of depression and anxiety, bullying, and sociodemographic factors.
Participants and Setting: Data was collected from N = 2,842 adolescents and young adults aged 11 - 25 years attending 42 secondary schools across four counties in Kenya. 
Methods: We conducted Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) to assess the factor structure of the ACE questionnaire. Internal consistency was evaluated using Cronbach’s alpha. Linear mixed-effects models were used to examine associations between ACEs and sociodemographic factors, bullying , depressive (PHQ-8) and anxiety(GAD-7) symptoms.
Results: EFA initially yielded a three-factor model, but a two-factor model provided better fit (CFI = 0.962, TLI = 0.948, RMSEA = 0.033, SRMR = 0.028). Higher ACE scores were significantly associated with depressive symptoms (β = 0.05, p &lt; 0.001), anxiety symptoms (β = 0.08, p &lt; 0.001), and bullying (β = 0.06, p &lt; 0.001). Bullying was more strongly associated with ACE scores among males (β = 0.05, p &lt; 0.001).
Conclusions: This study provides the first validation of the ACE questionnaire in Kenya and highlights the significant associations between childhood adversity and adolescent mental ill health. Findings underscore the need for trauma-informed interventions and further research into protective factors that may mitigate the effects of ACEs in LMICs.",2025-07-22,"ACEs,Abuse and neglect,Adverse Childhood Experiences,Bullying,Kenyan adolescents",,,"David Ndetei, Faith Kamau, Jasmit, Rosine Baseke, Winnan Munyasa, Victoria Mutiso, Zul Merali, Christine Wasanga, Moses Kachama Nyongesa, Maureen Ngesa",psyarxiv
E01BC-C63-718,Developing novel co-produced methodology to understand ‘real-world’ help-seeking in online peer-peer communities by young people experiencing emotional abuse and neglect,"Background: Recent systematic reviews suggest mediating factors (barriers and facilitators) of help-seeking for children and young people (CYP) with a range of mental health problems but highlight the need for more robust methodology underpinned by theoretical frameworks. Emotional abuse and neglect is the most prevalent and pervasive form of abuse, with many CYP remaining unknown to professional services. These CYP are underrepresented in help-seeking research yet seek help from their peers via anonymous online publicly available message communities. Objectives: To sensitively co-develop qualitative methodology to explore ‘real-world’ data to inform our understanding of help-seeking for these CYP, and define potential mediators (barriers and facilitators) and mechanisms of change associated with online peer support. Methods: Co-production with 10 young co-researchers (YCoR; aged 14-18 years) from NeurOX Young People’s Advisory Board (YPAG) included co-development and triangulation of different research methods (i.e., interpretative phenomenological, thematic, and conversation analyses) to analyse rich ethnographic material from 20 publicly available online message conversations between help-seekers experiencing or questioning emotional abuse and neglect. A theoretical model of adolescent help-seeking proposed by Rickwood et al. (2005) was used as a conceptual framework to guide methodological development. Results: The methodological approach facilitated identification of barriers and facilitators of help-seeking contextualised to the lives of these CYP: understanding and validating of abuse, emotional competence, fears and uncertainties around disclosure, knowledge, motivational factors, and connection/trusted relationships. Notably, positive changes in expressed or perceived ‘psychological state’ and/or intention to seek help were noticed in 9 of 10 message threads that included a ‘conversation’ (≥3 posts). Themes associated with change related to: connection with supportive peers; compassionate responding; and, the safeness of the online community. The existing adolescent help-seeking model was found to be too simplistic to account for help-seeking associated with emotional abuse and neglect. Conclusion: The novel methodological approach offers a meaningful way to explore ‘real-world’ data with YCoR, for a population underrepresented in help-seeking research. Proposed relational mechanisms involve connection, compassion and online communities. Further research coproduced with YCoR with diverse care experiences and characteristics is required to upscale the methodology and further validate and extend the findings. Public contribution: The core study was co-produced with 10 young co-researchers from the NeurOX YPAG who have been involved in over 135 hours on and offline work. Their roles involved co-deciding the direction of the study, evolving methodology, detailed co-analysis and reflective processes throughout all aspects of the study, interpretation, presentation and discussion of the findings with the NSPCC and Childline, and involvement in all communications.

E01C3-BDC-45C,The importance of stimulus variability when studying face processing using Fast Periodic Visual Stimulation: A novel ‘Mixed-Emotions’ paradigm,"Fast Periodic Visual Stimulation (FPVS) with oddball stimuli has been used to investigate discrimination of facial identity and emotion, with studies concluding that oddball responses indicate discrimination of faces at the conceptual level (i.e. discrimination of identity and emotion), rather than low-level perceptual (visual, image-based) discrimination. However, because previous studies have utilised identical images as base stimuli, physical differences between base and oddball stimuli, rather than recognition of identity or emotion, may have been responsible for oddball responses. This study tested two new FPVS paradigms designed to distinguish recognition of expressions of emotion from basic detection of visual change. In both paradigms, the oddball emotional expression was different from that of the base stream images. However, in the 'fixed-emotion' paradigm, stimulus image varied at every presentation but the emotion in the base stream remained constant, and in the 'mixed-emotions' paradigm, both stimulus image and emotion varied at every presentation, with only the oddball emotion (disgust) remaining constant. In the fixed-emotion paradigm, typical inversion effects were observed at occipital sites. In the mixed-emotions paradigm, however, inversion effects in a central cluster (indicative of higher level emotion processing) were present in typical participants, but not those with alexithymia (who are impaired at emotion recognition), suggesting that only the mixed-emotions paradigm reflects emotion recognition rather than lower-level visual processing or basic detection of change. These results have significant methodological implications for future FPVS studies (of both facial emotion and identity), suggesting that it is crucial to vary base stimuli sufficiently, such that simple physical differences between base and oddball stimuli cannot give rise to neural oddball responses.",2018-11-09T11:33:29.608981+00:00,"fast periodic visual stimulation,implicit,alexithymia,facial expressions",,,"Geoffrey Bird, Michel-Pierre Coll, Rebecca Brewer, Caroline Catmur, Jennifer Murphy",psyarxiv
E0191-13D-974,The Effects of Eugenic Bias and Moral Emotions on Lay Legal Judgments in a Sterilization Case Involving Intellectual Disability,"Abstract
Objective:  To examine public opinion on a medical procedure involving the non-consensual sterilization of individuals with intellectual disabilities.
Method:  A mock jury design was employed with 213 participants (148 female) who evaluated a vignette describing a surgeon performing a tubal ligation on an intellectually disabled patient. The vignette varied across five experimental conditions by manipulating the presence of intellectual disability, genetic risk, and a judicial decision to remove the child from parental custody after birth. We assessed how emotions, moral judgments, the surgeon’s stated rationale, and underlying attitudes, including potential eugenic dispositions, influenced participants’ sentencing recommendations.
Results:  Findings revealed three distinct participant profiles. One group (the rejecters) consistently deemed the procedure wholly unjustifiable, expressing strong moral condemnation regardless of the surgeon’s explanation. A second group (the apologists) was more inclined to justify the sterilization when the rationale involved disability or potential genetic transmission, exhibiting lower moral outrage and stronger eugenicist attitudes. The third group (the contextual evaluators) offered more nuanced judgments by taking situational factors, such as child risk or insufficient parental support, into account, thereby prioritizing caregiving considerations over disability status alone.
Conclusions:  The study demonstrates that sentencing recommendations are shaped by emotional and moral responses to perceived genetic and child welfare risks. These findings have important implications for juror education, public policy, and the protection of reproductive rights for individuals with intellectual disabilities.",2025-05-20,,,,"Hakim Djeriouat, Eva VIVES, Astrid Thébault Guiochon, Agnès Falco, Bastien Trémolière",psyarxiv
E0008-7CE-489,Too tempting to resist? Self-control moderates the relationship between narcissism and antisocial tendencies,"Previous research highlights that narcissism predicts a wide range of antisocial tendencies. We propose that the expression of such tendencies is contingent on the level of dispositional self-control. Three independent studies (Ntotal = 1,458) using three different narcissism measures and self-reported as well as behavioral indicators of antisocial tendencies tested this moderation hypothesis. In Study 1, antagonistic narcissism was positively related to self-reported revenge following an interpersonal transgression and this relationship was weakened among individuals high (vs. low) in self-control. Studies 2 and 3 conceptually replicated this finding using different narcissism measures, respectively, and trait (Study 2) as well as behaviorally assessed aggression (Study 3) as outcome variables. Results support the moderating role of self-control in the antagonistic narcissism-antisociality link.",2021-11-25T11:31:52.865175+00:00,,,,"Ramzi Fatfouta, Radosław Rogoza, Katrin Rentzsch, Piotr Paweł Brud",psyarxiv
E020C-59F-F69,"Pathways between child maltreatment, psychological symptoms, and life satisfaction: a network analysis in adolescent inpatients","Background: Child maltreatment is a risk factor for mental disorders and decreased life satisfaction during adolescence. We investigated whether child maltreatment would link to life satisfaction both directly and through psychological symptoms, whether these relations would change from admission to discharge after treatment, and which types of maltreatment, symptoms and facets of life satisfaction would be most influential in adolescent inpatients with internalizing mental disorders. Methods: N = 896 adolescent receiving inpatient psychotherapeutic treatment completed questionnaires on child maltreatment experiences, current psychopathology and subjective life satisfaction at admission and discharge (n = 765). Main diagnoses were affective (n = 322), eating (n = 447), obsessive–compulsive (n = 70) and anxiety disorders (n = 57). Network models of child maltreatment, psychopathology and life satisfaction nodes were estimated at admission and discharge and compared using network comparison tests. Potential causal shortest pathways were investigated using directed acyclic graphs. Results: Network models were stable with no significant differences between admission and discharge. Strongest nodes of each cluster were “emotional abuse” (child maltreatment), “worthlessness”, “thinking about dying” and “feeling lonely” (psychopathology) and “satisfied with life” (life satisfaction) at both admission and discharge. Emotional neglect showed direct connections to life satisfaction, indicating its relevance for therapeutic interventions. At both admission and discharge, “sexual abuse” indirectly predicted lower life satisfaction through psychological symptoms. Conclusions: Child maltreatment is directly and indirectly connected to life satisfaction in adolescents with mental disorders. Emotional abuse and neglect were especially important in linking child maltreatment to life satisfaction and psychopathology.",2022-09-21T07:09:40.550898+00:00,"depression,adolescence,childhood trauma,eating disorder,life satisfaction",,,"Sebastian Ertl, Adrian Meule, Silke Naab, Giammarco Cascino, Alessio Maria Monteleone, David Kolar, Ulrich Voderholzer",psyarxiv
E0031-38D-31B,The association between childhood maltreatment and multidimensional sleep health in a high-risk adolescent population,"Background – Impaired sleep following trauma such as childhood maltreatment is both a prognostic factor for future mental illness and a feasible intervention point. Yet, associations between childhood maltreatment and objectively measured sleep components are rarely found. New approaches advance the use of multidimensional sleep health scores instead. However, no such methodology has been used to study the consequences of maltreatment on sleep health in adolescent cohorts so far. We hypothesized that childhood maltreatment will be associated with poorer sleep health in adolescence. Methods – a cross-sectional sample of 479 adolescents from a high-risk population-based cohort (mean age 17.9) completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire short form (CTQ-SF) to assess five forms of maltreatment (emotional and physical abuse/neglect and sexual abuse) assessed as continuous sum scores. During 9 nights of actigraphy and sleep diary measurements data on sleep timing, duration, efficiency, and regularity was collected, which were combined into a sleep health composite score ranging from 0 to 6. Linear regression models were adjusted for age, sex, household income, ethnic origin, educational level, urbanization of living environment and parental psychopathological problems. Results – associations were found between all forms of maltreatment and poorer sleep health (p&lt;.010). Partial r effect sizes ranged from -0.12 [95%CI = -0.21, -0.03] for sexual abuse to -0.17 [-0.25, -0.08] for emotional neglect. Sensitivity analyses indicated the results were robust to unmeasured confounding.

E022D-B67-B7C,The Police Use of Background Information Related to Alleged Victims in Mock Evaluations of Child Sexual Abuse,"When statistically related to child sexual abuse (CSA), background information can assist decision-making in investigations of CSA allegations. Here, we studied the use of such background information among Finnish police officers. We analyzed their ability to identify and interpret CSA-related and -unrelated background information both when placed in mock scenarios and when presented as separate variables. We also measured the ability to correctly estimate the base-rate of CSA allegations being true based on such background information. In the context of mock scenarios, officers were better in discarding CSA-unrelated variables than in identifying CSA-related ones. Within-subject performance across different scenarios was, however, not consistent. When information was presented as separate variables, officers tended to incorrectly consider many CSA-unrelated variables as CSA-related. Officers performed well in recognizing whether CSA-related variables increase or decrease CSA risk. Finally, officers were inaccurate in identifying variables that are CSA-related only for boys or only for girls. When asked to estimate the CSA probability of mock scenarios, participants were accurate only in assessing low-probability cases, and this was not associated with the ability to identify CSA-related and -unrelated variables. We conclude that police officers would benefit from more training in using background information and from using available decision-making support tools in the context of investigating CSA allegations.",2019-01-14T15:33:41.404540+00:00,"evidence,police investigation,probability estimation,background information,child sexual abuse",,,"Alessandro Tadei, Pekka Santtila, Jan Antfolk",psyarxiv
E0118-CA4-664,Relations between Childhood Psychological Maltreatment and Mental Health Dimensions within a Higher-order Model,"Experiences of childhood psychological maltreatment have been found to be associated with various mental health outcomes, and this association persists into adulthood. This study investigated whether some types of psychological maltreatment are more harmful than others; whether the harms associated with different types of psychological maltreatment are generalized or specific to particular domains of psychopathology; and whether the associations vary by gender. Participants (N = 544, 63.9% mother as primary caregiver) were Chinese adults from various regions in China. Participants completed measures of childhood psychological maltreatment experiences perpetrated by their primary caregiver and the mental health outcomes of depression, anxiety, anger, physical aggression, and hostility. The data were analyzed in a hierarchical model in which depression and anxiety were defined as indicators of an internalizing factor, while anger, physical aggression, and hostility were defined as indicators of an externalizing factor. Internalizing and externalizing then defined a higher-order general psychopathology factor. The results suggested equivalent harms of psychological abuse and psychological neglect. Further, the associations between psychological maltreatment and mental health were not unique to specific symptoms domains but showed broadband associations with general psychopathology. These findings suggest that trans-diagnostic interventions may be the most effective approach for addressing the mental health impacts of psychological maltreatment.",2022-06-28T15:50:03.934904+00:00,"trans-diagnostic psychopathology,psychological abuse,psychological neglect,psychopathology,psychological maltreatment",,,"Aja Louise Murray, Zhuoni Xiao, Ingrid Obsuth, Franziska Meinck",psyarxiv

E00CA-B36-719,"Perceptions of Physical, Sexual, and Psychological Violence Stories: A Registered Report","Survivors of sexual violence have shared their stories with the public through social media in growing numbers. Recent research shows that sexual violence (versus other, less stigmatizing trauma) stories are perceived as more difficult to tell, and their storytellers less likeable. This is true even when stories have redemptive endings, contradicting an established U.S. cultural preference for redemptive stories. However, it is unknown if sexual violence perceptions generalize to different types of interpersonal violence (IPV) and if audience perceptions vary across 3 major types of IPV (sexual, physical, psychological). This pre-registered replication and extension study investigates these questions with a vignette-based experimental design modeled after 2 published studies by the first and last authors. Broadly, we hypothesized that cultural invalidation of sexual violence stories would extend to any IPV story (vs. non-IPV traumas such as natural disasters), and that within the realm of IPV, cultural invalidation would be more pronounced for psychological violence stories (vs. sexual/physical). Three samples of U.S. adult participants (N=1,045), 2 Nationally Representative and 1 University-based, were randomly assigned online to read 1 of 12 first-person trauma story vignettes and complete self-report surveys of story and storyteller perceptions in a 6 (trauma story: IPV [k=3], non-IPV [k=3]) x 2 (ending: negative, redemptive) between-subjects design. Support for our hypotheses was mixed. IPV (vs. non-IPV) stories were perceived as more difficult to share (η2p = .068) and their storytellers as having less positive personality traits (η2p = .043), even when stories ended redemptively. However, among the 3 IPV types, psychological violence storytellers were not robustly more stigmatized, and sexual violence stories were recognized as particularly difficult to disclose. IPV survivors face obstacles to telling their stories that may hamper both personal recovery and collective momentum for systemic change.",2022-06-07T19:31:35.260389+00:00,"cultural stigma,narrative identity,trauma,redemption,psychological abuse,psychological violence,physical violence,sexual violence,master narrative,interpersonal violence,intimate partner violence,physical abuse,sexual assault",,,"Paige K Michel, Kate C.

E01AF-699-6B6,Potential Sequels of Physical Abuse in Childhood,"The hypothesis is presented here that individuals with certain disorders or neuroses, autism spectrum and obsessive-compulsive in particular, were on average more often physically abused during their childhood than those with e.g. attention deficit hyperactivity or histrionic personality disorders. Both latter conditions are usually not mentioned in the literature among consequences of physical abuse. Furthermore, the maltreatment can modify manifestations of affective disorders. Prolonged maltreatment can induce psychiatric abnormalities also in initially healthy individuals, in particular, paranoid ideations. Children and adolescents regularly punished for hyperactivity or other behaviors, regarded by perpetrators to be undesirable, would discontinue these behaviors but start adaptive or maladaptive conduct that may be more or less compatible with autism spectrum and obsessive-compulsive disorders. Repetitive binge drinking can be compulsive. Besides, loitering with drinking companies is a way of escape from domestic violence. It is known that autistic persons tend to avoid socialization. However, in conditions of collectivism and a pressure to be “normal” like everyone, individuals with communication abnormalities would have strong motives to contact with peers to avoid stigmatization. Alcohol consumption and, in particular, binge drinking is a method to overcome communication barriers. In doing so, the individuals often forget that excessive alcohol consumption may cause health problems.",2024-11-18T19:14:05.507188+00:00,,,,Sergei V. Jargin,psyarxiv

Methods: Data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s (SAMHSA) 2018 National Survey for Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) were analyzed. The unweighted sample included 6,999 adults representing a weighted population size of 33,900,452.122 in the US. Results and Conclusions: The findings of this retrospective research confirmed that age and marital status significantly predicted BAU in the past month among adults with MDE. Adults with MDE at higher risk for BAU were adults under the age of 50, adults who were never married, and adults who were divorced/separated. Special attention must be paid to those in age groups under 50, never married, and have been separated/divorced who are particularly at-risk for future alcohol abuse.

We tested the effect of an online training for school staff members in Europe through three studies. In Study I, we interviewed 5 adult women (Mage = 49.2, SD = 5.81) who were victims of sexual abuse during childhood to detect what school could have done during that time to protect them. Through Study II, we collected data on 66 school staff to assess feasibility (based on quantitative indicators) and to explore the changes they would make to their everyday practice due to the training course (using qualitative analysis). In Study III, we used network analysis to assess to what extent the actions described by school staff in Study II met the needs expressed by the victims in Study I. Findings of Study I revealed new proposals from the victims’ perspective, such as working with the perpetrators. Study II showed the feasibility of training and identified five types of action that school staff members will include in their everyday working dynamics due to the training: detection (e.g., Greater attention to relationships with peers), reporting (e.g., Now I know that suspecting a case of child abuse is enough to report), everyday practices (e.g., Introducing a calming space), changes at school level (e.g., Propose the training course to the school management team) or practices that could belong to more than one category (e.g., Greater awareness of the activities undertaken by the school). Study III provided evidence that some of these changes (e.g., reporting without looking for proof) were in line with some of the victims’ expectations (e.g., listen to the children). We also identified gaps that need to be further developed.",2021-07-23T11:46:05.338967+00:00,"victimization,school,violence",,,"Marina Bartolomé, Noemí Pereda, Carla González-Pío, Ana Martina Greco",psyarxiv
E01A2-5DF-A61,Predicting Suggestive Questioning from Cognitions and Emotions about Child Sexual Abuse across Three Study Paradigms,"Objective: Although interviews and conversations are highly individual in nature, and suggestiveness is a major pitfall when questioning children, differential aspects of interviewer bias and suggestiveness remain understudied. We assessed the influence of Cognitions and Emotions about Child Sexual Abuse (CECSA) on suggestive questioning and a biased mindset toward the abuse hypothesis across a series of three studies with varying mock paradigms and a meta-analytical integration. Hypotheses: For all studies, we expect the scores on the three CECSA scales (Naive Confidence, Emotional Reactivity, and Justice System Distrust) to be associated with the number of suggestive questions and indicators of a biased mindset. Method: In all studies, participants read mock cases about children displaying mild behavioral symptoms that were unspecific but gave rise to suspecting sexual abuse. In Study 1, 285 human sciences students further read interview transcripts and selected questions suitable to pose to the child. In Study 2, 241 police students read interview transcripts and freely formulated questions to pose to the children. In Study 3, 148 teaching students interviewed virtual children using natural language in a Virtual Reality setting. Results: Across three studies and their meta-analytical integration, we found robust evidence that Naive Confidence and Emotional Reactivity, but not Justice System Distrust, significantly predict bias and suggestive questioning, with effect sizes of b = .14–.37. The newly developed measures to assess suggestive questioning validly captured a unidimensional trait of suggestive questioning but showed unsatisfying reliability. Conclusions: The findings enhance our understanding of individual differences in suggestive questioning and bias and can inform the development, customization, and evaluation of interviewer training programs, as well as the selection of interview personnel. We also provide recommendations to increase the reliability of the suggestiveness measures in future research.",2024-09-11T19:59:18.296335+00:00,,,,"Simone Pülschen, Marie Merschhemke, Dietrich Pülschen, Renate Volbert, Elsa Gewehr",psyarxiv
E014A-409-3E0,"Risk and protective factors for self-harm, suicidal thoughts, and suicide attempts in LGBTQ+ young people in the Republic of Ireland: the XXXX  study (blinded for review)","Aims: This study aimed to provide an account of prevalence and the risk and protective correlates of self-harm, suicidal thoughts, and suicide attempt in Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer (LGBTQ+) young people in the Republic of Ireland (RoI). 
 
Methods: Data from a national survey of 1,191 LGBTQ+ young people aged between 14 and 25 years were analysed. This self-report epidemiological survey assessed lifetime incidence of self-harm, suicidal thoughts, and suicide attempt. Information on sociodemographic characteristics, mental health (including depression, anxiety, and stress), alcohol and/or drug use, self-esteem and resilience, supportive family and friends, in-person abuse, online abuse and LGBTQ+ bullying in school was collected. Data were collected between 13 September-31 October 2022 via an online survey accessible to people who identified as LGBTQ+, were 14 years of age or over and living in the RoI. 
 
Results: The prevalence of lifetime self-harm, suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts were 68.5% (n=758/1106), 75.5% (n=831/1100) and 32.6% (n=339/1041) respectively. Some gendered differences were identified, with transgender and cisgender-women reporting higher rates of self-harm compared to cisgender-men. Similarly, participants who reported  physical and neurodevelopmental disabilities had comparatively higher odds of self-harm, suicidal thoughts and suicide attempt compared to those without. In general, anxiety and depression, but not stress, and drug, but not alcohol use, were associated with increased odds of any suicide-related outcome explored. By contrast higher levels of self-esteem and resilience were associated with lower rates of self-harm, suicidal thoughts and suicide attempt. A lack of support of one’s LGBTQ+ identity from immediate family was further found to increase risk. Likewise, online and in-person identity abuse predicted higher rates of self-harm, suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts. No significant association between religion and any suicide-related outcome was identified.
 
Conclusions: These findings highlight high rates of self-harm, suicidal thoughts, and suicide attempts experienced by LGBTQ+ young people in the RoI. Several risk correlates were identified including gender, anxiety and depression, drug use, and abuse, both online and in person. Although many of these factors may be regarded as ‘universal determinants’ of suicidality, these risks may be qualitatively different for LGBTQ+ young people. Support of one’s gender or sexual identity is a protective factor. Therefore, a combination of universal and tailored supports could help LGBTQ+ young people experiencing self-harm, suicidal thoughts and suicide attempt.",2025-09-19,,,,"Prof. Louise Doyle, Carmel Downes, Barry Coughlan, Gemma Cox, Aviejay Paul, Prof Agnes Higgins, Brian Keogh, Katerina Kavalidou",psyarxiv
E0002-14F-7E4,"The ‘casting couch’ scenario: Impact of perceived employment benefit, reporting delay, complainant gender, and participant gender on juror decision-making in rape cases","Recent media reports of contemporary and historical rape and sexual assault cases have focused on the entertainment industry, particularly around the notion of the ‘casting couch’. This scenario, in which a powerful figure obtains sometimes non-consensual sexual acts from subordinate actors in exchange for employment, was used to explore the influence of rape myths and Sexual Economics Theory on mock-juror decision-making. Participant-jurors (n = 907) viewed video and written testimony of a complainant, accusing a male producer of rape. Complainant gender (male, female), delay before reporting the incident to the police (immediately, six months, ten years), and complainant casting in the production were randomly varied (acting role secured, not secured). The strongest effects were that females (79.7%) were significantly more likely than males (62.7%) to deliver a guilty verdict and to recommend longer prison sentences for the offence. When the complainant did not secure the acting role, and they delayed reporting the incident for six months, there was a trend for guilty verdict rates to be slightly higher when the complainant was male (80.5%) than female (64.5%). No interacting complainant gender effects on trial outcomes were found in the other delay conditions, or when the actor secured employment. Defendant guilt attributions to the male and female complainant were also differently influenced by rape myth belief levels and homophobic attitudes, but not beliefs in a just world. The casting couch euphemism, reported worldwide, suggests industry acceptance, and may sanitise the act of demanding sex and even committing rape. However, these results have important implications for any occupational setting in which men in positions of power may sexually exploit junior staff.",2019-08-19T19:39:52.980251+00:00,"sexual assault,juror decision making,casting couch,rape myths,jury decision making",,,"Shona Mcintosh, Josh P Davis",psyarxiv
E0124-EA3-D37,How Old was She? The Accuracy of Assessing the Age of Adolescents Based on Photos,"Information on the degree to which individuals can make accurate estimations of someone’s age can be of importance in legal contexts, such as child sexual abuse cases in which the victim is an adolescent. There is, however, a scarcity of studies concerning age estimations conducted with young target persons. Using facial photos of target persons aged 12–18 years, we investigated the effects of gender, age, and ethnicity of both targets (n = 240) and observers (n = 869) on the accuracy of age estimation. We also investigated the effects of targets’ facial expressions (neutral or smiling), use of makeup, and photo quality. Participants overestimated the age of the adolescents by, on average, 3.51 years. Participants overestimated the age of young adolescent girls to a greater extent than that of younger boys. Men made larger overestimations than women. Participants also estimated smiling targets as being older than targets with neutral facial expression, and the age of girls with makeup to be older than girls without makeup. Because there was considerable variation in the accuracy of estimations, and overestimates were common, we conclude that the ability of individuals to estimate the age of young persons is generally low. this might have important legal implications.",2021-01-27T10:35:30.544993+00:00,"age of sexual consent,age estimation,adolescents,legal psychology,child sexual abuse",,,"Linda C.

E0151-056-889,A Social Neuroscience Approach to Interpersonal Interaction in the Context of Disruption and Disorganization of Attachment (NAMDA),"Humans are strongly dependent upon social resources for allostasis and emotion regulation. This applies especially to early childhood because humans – as an altricial species – have a prolonged period of dependency on support and input from caregivers who typically act as sources of co-regulation. Accordingly, attachment theory proposes that the history and quality of early interactions with primary caregivers shape children’s internal working models of attachment. In turn, these attachment models guide behavior, initially with the set goal of maintaining proximity to caregivers, but eventually paving the way to more generalized mental representations of self and others. Mounting evidence in nonclinical populations suggests that these mental representations coincide with differential patterns of neural structure, function, and connectivity in a range of brain regions previously associated with emotional and cognitive capacities. What is currently lacking, however, is an evidence-based account of how early adverse attachment-related experiences and/or the emergence of attachment disorganization impact the developing brain. While work on early childhood adversities offers important insights, we propose that how these events become biologically embedded crucially hinges on the context of the child-caregiver attachment relationships in which the events take place. Our selective review distinguishes between direct social neuroscience research on disorganized attachment and indirect maltreatment-related research, converging on aberrant functioning in neurobiological systems subserving aversion, approach, emotion regulation, and mental state processing in the wake of severe attachment disruption. To account for heterogeneity of findings, we propose two distinct neurobiological phenotypes characterized by hyper- and hypo-arousal primarily deriving from the caregiver serving either as a threatening or as an insufficient source of co-regulation, respectively.",2020-08-05T08:15:10.164183+00:00,"social neuroscience,social interaction,neglect and abuse,maltreatment,disorganized attachment,disrupted attachment",,,"Margerete Schött, Jessica Borelli, Jan Keil, Melanie Kungl, Lars White, Pascal Vrticka, Charlotte Catharina Schulz",psyarxiv
E01C2-D90-E10,Role of Emotion in Child Maltreatment Risk during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Purpose: Preliminary research early in the COVID-19 pandemic suggested children appeared to be at increased risk for child maltreatment, particularly as parents struggled with mental health and economic strains. Such strains were likely to influence parental emotions about their children, affecting their parent-child interactions to contribute to elevated maltreatment risk. To identify the potential affective elements that may contribute to such increased maltreatment risk, the current study focused on whether maternal worry about children’s behavior specifically as well as maternal anger were related to increased risk for neglect or physical or psychological aggression six months into the pandemic. Method: The racially diverse sample included 193 mothers who completed an online survey during the COVID-19 pandemic in late September-early October 2020. Results: Mothers’ reported increases in neglect and physical and psychological aggression during the pandemic were significantly related with established measures of maltreatment risk. Furthermore, path models indicated that maternal anger and worry about children’s behavior, as well as their interaction, were significantly related to indicators of physical aggression risk and neglect during the pandemic, but only maternal anger related to increased psychological aggression during the pandemic. Conclusions: Maternal worry and anger about children’s behavior may have exacerbated risk for maltreatment under the stressful conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings suggest affective reactions of both parental worry and anger focused on child behavior warrants greater empirical attention and consideration in intervention efforts both during the pandemic and potentially post-pandemic.",2021-08-25T18:37:21.067747+00:00,"anxiety,coronavirus,neglect,verbal aggression,parenting,child abuse,conflict tactics scales",,,"Christina Rodriguez, Shawna J.

Although male adolescents in vocational education or youth care may be at increased risk of perpetrating SDV, little is known about effective gender-specific prevention. Therefore, we conducted a quasi-experimental evaluation of a Dutch group-counseling program promoting psychosexual health and preventing SDV among male adolescents aged 12–18 years: Make a Move. The 66 participating male adolescents completed three questionnaires (baseline, post-test, 3-month follow-up; 48.5% retention). We also conducted interviews with a subsample of four adolescents and two trainers and performed observations in one group. With these multi-method, multi-informant data, we evaluated program effectiveness on the six intended outcomes (attitudes, social norms, self-efficacy, skills, intentions and SDV perpetration) by 1) statistically comparing self-reports between the intervention and control groups; 2) thematically analyzing interview data and 3) describing three individual male adolescent cases, triangulating questionnaire, interview, and observation data. We found limitations in program integrity, and evidence for program effectiveness on skills, mixed evidence on attitudes, self-efficacy and intentions, but no evidence for effectiveness on socials norms or SDV perpetration. We also found indications of adverse effects on attitudes and intentions. We offer suggestions for program refinement and future program evaluations.",2025-04-25,"adolescent relationship abuse,adolescent sexual harrassment,intervention,male youth,mixed-methods",,,"Joyce Weeland, dr.

E00B6-2CF-062,The legal intersection of psychosis and substance use: A mixed-methods investigation of settled insanity,"Substance use and psychosis frequently co-occur and are complexly interrelated. Nevertheless, the legal system sometimes requires conclusions regarding the causal effects of substance use on psychosis (e.g., to determine insanity defense eligibility — including “settled” insanity from chronic substance use). Objectives: We sought to understand how courts and mental health professionals conceptualize and resolve settled insanity claims. Hypotheses: Study 1 had no a priori hypotheses. Study 2 hypothesized a successful insanity defense would be seen as most possible for defendant when no substance use was implicated and least possible for defendants acutely intoxicated at the time of crime, with settled insanity falling between. Method: We conducted a case law review (Study 1: N=51 settled insanity cases), coding history and outcomes, substances involved, viability from a clinical science perspective, and qualitative reasons for case outcomes. And we conducted an experiment to evaluate the perspectives of mental health experts on the legal intersection of substance use and mental illness across three types of cases (Study 2: N=310 U.S. licensed psychologists, 52% female, Mage=37.66, Mexperience=18.71 years). Results: In Study 1, 29.41% of the settled insanity cases were potentially viable on clinical science grounds, whereas only a single legal case (1.96%) was actually successful. Qualitative analyses showed courts often disallow settled insanity based on the very characteristics that define it. Study 2 found mental health experts evaluate evidence of permanent mental illness similarly, regardless of whether a legal defense of insanity is general or settled in nature. And they largely opine defendants who are actively and voluntarily intoxicated at the time of the crime are not legally insane, consistent with the law. Conclusions: The legal doctrine of settled insanity does not map well onto clinical reality and complicates the intersection of intoxication and mental illness by prompting insoluble questions about the etiology of mental illness.",2025-06-26,"assessment,etiology,forensic,insanity,intoxication,psychiatry,psychosis,substance abuse,substance use",,,"Maya A.

However, we observed greater rates of depression and anxiety of assigned females at birth (but not for assigned males at birth) in the more recent cohort, at the same time that reported social adversity (bullying and abuse) was falling. Also, of interest, the proportion of young people who had partially or fully socially transitioned prior to contact with the service had increased overtime.

E0181-958-587,Collective narcissism and its social consequences: The Bad and the Ugly,"Collective narcissism is a belief that one’s own group (the in-group) is exceptional but not sufficiently recognized by others. It is the form of ‘in-group love’ associated with ‘out-group hate’. In contrast to private collective self-esteem (a belief that the in-group is of high value), it consistently predicts prejudice, retaliatory intergroup aggression, and rejoicing in suffering of others. The pervasive association between collective narcissism and intergroup hostility is driven by a biased perception of intergroup situations that serves to protect undermined self-worth and frustrated personal entitlement invested in the in-group’s image. Collective narcissism is associated with hypersensitivity to provocation and the belief that only hostile revenge is a desirable and rewarding response. It arises when the traditional group-based hierarchies are challenged and empowers extremists as well as populist politicians. Instead of alleviating, it re-fuels a sense of threatened self-importance. The association between collective narcissism and intergroup hostility is weakened by experiences fortifying emotional resilience (e.g., positive identification with a community).",2020-02-10T17:55:43.836978+00:00,"populism,: collective narcissism,collective self-esteem,intergroup hostility,prejudice",,,"Dorottya Lantos, Agnieszka Golec",psyarxiv

Five event-types of public violence are identified—in addition to the well-known night-time economy related type, we found classes characterized by excessively violent behaviors; revenge among familiar persons; weapon use and severe victim injuries; and disrespect encounters in everyday contexts.

Subjective perception is considered a key element in the prediction of resistant or vulnerable responses to trauma and crisis. This study aimed to assess the relationship between perceived physical life threat (PT) and perceived life impact (PI) with post-traumatic symptomatology (PTSD), in a sample of 3.565 persons from 12 countries across nine different traumatic events. Methods . Participants were classified into four groups of self-perceived resistance based on their levels of PT and PI. Results . Main results show Non-affected was the most frequent category in natural catastrophes (48.9%), migration (45.9%), motor vehicle accidents (39.83%), and death threats (33.4%). In the case of sexual abuse by a relative or close person (44.5%), sexual abuse by a stranger (33.9%), and having a severe, chronic, or disabling illness (47.3%), the most frequent category was Survivor . For domestic violence, the most frequent category was Vulnerable (45.5%). Resistant was never the most frequent category for any of the events studied. Although gender and lower education predicted PTSD in most events of trauma and crisis, they were a weak predictor of vulnerable versus resistance categories. Conclusion These results suggest that the Perceived Resistance Indicator can provide insights into the narratives of resistance or vulnerability associated with extreme experiences.",2020-11-16T13:23:27.571246+00:00,"perceived resistance,trauma,vivo questionnaire,life crisis,worldviews",,,"Andrea Galán-Santamarina, ​Francisco José Eiroa-Orosa, Alberto Fernández-Liria, Elena Barbero-Val, Pau Pérez-Sales, Pablo Olivos-Jara, María Vergara-Campos",psyarxiv

Abusers may consciously exploit these tactics to ensure dependence and enable continued abuse. To demonstrate this, I use research on abusers’ controlling and coercive tactics and delineate the predictable effects on victims such as lowering their awareness of the violence, decreasing the likelihood of disclosure, and locating blame for the abuse in the victim. In doing so, I also marshal the limited research on coercive tactics in LGBTQIA+ relationships to broaden understanding of coercive tactics in relationships outside of solely heterosexual couples. Abusive relationships in which coercive tactics are used to establish and maintain control may lead to worse mental and physical health outcomes for the victim and may be more violent than bi-directional violence and other forms of intimate partner violence. These dynamics may have unique and pernicious effects on LGBTQIA+ couples. Understanding the patterns of coercive behaviors may help abused partners decrease self-blame and understand the broader context in which they and their abuser are situated which is vital to better understand the dynamics of violence and to end violence.",2021-01-27T20:18:25.954585+00:00,"intimate partner violence,coercion,trauma,same-sex couples,lgbt",,,Cindy Veldhuis,psyarxiv
E0003-4B6-25A,Neurobiological Entanglement: A Systems-Level Framework for Understanding Narcissistic Abuse in Neurodivergent Populations,"Abusive relationships are profoundly shaped by the interaction of distinct neurobiological profiles. This paper proposes a systems-level framework—defined as the interaction between neural, endocrine, and behavioral systems—of neurobiological entanglement to explain the self-perpetuating cycles of exploitation and dependency in relationships involving individuals with covert narcissistic traits and neurodivergent individuals, particularly those with ADHD or autism. The framework integrates research on the neurobiological mechanisms of perpetrators, who exhibit high cognitive but low emotional empathy, with the neurodivergent vulnerabilities of victims, including dopamine dysregulation and heightened oxytocin sensitivity. We conceptualize trauma bonding as a neurochemical process that shares key features with addiction, driven by intermittent reinforcement that exploits these inherent sensitivities. The long-term consequences of this abuse, including alterations to the hippocampus, amygdala, HPA axis, and default mode network, are discussed. Finally, we outline a neurobiologically-tailored recovery approach using the “Six Rs” framework. Given that neurodivergent individuals are significantly more likely to experience intimate partner violence—up to 47% in autistic women—this paper argues that recognizing narcissistic abuse as a neurobiological public health concern is essential for developing specialized, evidence-based interventions and policies to support neurodivergent survivors.",2025-08-07,"neurobiological entanglement, trauma bonding, covert narcissism, ADHD, autism, neurodivergence, instrumental empathy, dopamine dysregulation, oxytocin sensitivity, intermittent reinforcement, Six Rs recovery, intimate partner violence",,,Graeme Lithgow,psyarxiv
E00D0-B3E-6CC,Parental Social Isolation and Child Maltreatment Risk During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Background: On March 11, 2020, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The social isolation and economic stress resulting from pandemic have the potential to exacerbate child abuse and neglect. Objective: This study examines the association of parents’ perceived social isolation and recent employment loss to risk for child maltreatment (neglect, verbal aggression, and physical punishment) in the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants and Setting: Participants (N = 283) were adults living in the U.S. who were parents of at least one child 0-12 years of age. Methods: Participants completed an online survey approximately 2 weeks after the World Health Organization declared that COVID-19 was a pandemic. The survey asked about recent changes (i.e., in the past 2 weeks) to employment status, parenting behaviors, use of discipline, use of spanking, and depressive symptoms. Results: Parents’ perceived social isolation and recent employment loss were associated with self-report of physical and emotional neglect and verbal aggression against the child, even after statistically controlling for parental depressive symptoms, income, and sociodemographic factors. Parents’ perceived social isolation was associated with parental report of changes in discipline, specifically, using discipline and spanking more often in the past 2 weeks. Associations were robust to analyses that included two variables that assessed days spent social distancing and days spent in “lockdown.” Conclusions: Study results point to the need for mental health supports to parents and children to ameliorate the strain created by COVID-19.",2020-12-10T14:27:14.849719+00:00,"coronavirus,child abuse,physical abuse,depression,global health crisis,child wellbeing,pandemic,spank,discipline,psychological aggression,yelling,anxiety,child neglect,screaming,physical punishment,parent-child conflict tactics scales",,,"Kaitlin P.

E00CC-334-090,"A scoping review of systemic interventions against domestic violence in the Netherlands: Practice, proof, and perspectives","Background: Systemic approaches to intervene in domestic violence gain popularity in the Netherlands. Prescription of systemic interventions requires theoretical substance and empirically validated effectiveness, but rigorous trials remain scarce. We reviewed the methodological and substantive quality of systemic intervention studies published in the 21st century and their effective elements and contexts. Design: (Quasi-)Experimental studies of systemic interventions to end domestic violence in the Netherlands published since the seminal review by Flikweert and Lünnemann (2003) were identified and assessed, if the study focused on domestic violence perpetrated by an adult to the (ex-)partner and/or child(ren). Study quality was examined using criteria adapted from Flikweert and Lünnemann (2003), including sample size, design, and instruments. Results: Nineteen interventions were found in 28 studies and evaluations. Most interventions were “evaluated” (37%, 7/19) or not studied (26%, 5/19). Seven interventions were studied in nine trials with a repeated measures design (32%, 9/28). Only three interventions (16%, 3/19) were tested in five trials (18%, 5/28) containing a comparison group receiving care as usual. The single positive study was conducted by clinicians, without a comparison group. None of the nine trials provided evidence that systemic interventions outperformed care as usual. Conclusion: The literature on systemic interventions to end domestic violence was limited, heterogeneous, and dominated by evaluation studies, while many available effectiveness trials were limited by design. Replication trials should compare systemic interventions to care as usual, and examine differences between perpetrators and victims, to help more families access sources of resilience and end cycles of violence.",2022-02-23T12:20:14.083415+00:00,"child abuse,quasi-experimental trials,family systems approach,intimate partner violence,evaluations",,,"Róisín E.

E00AB-4CE-E6F,"‘In their own words’: a naturalistic co-produced study of young people’s experiences of emotional abuse and neglect expressed in anonymous, online peer-peer message forums","This naturalistic study researched online help-seeking conversations between children and young people (CYP) experiencing emotional abuse and/or neglect (emotional maltreatment) and their peers. We believe this is the first study internationally to perform such research. Engagement with anonymous, online communities potentially offer children a source of knowledge and platform to express and understand their experiences with peers on their own terms, using their own words. This study, co-produced with 10 young co-researchers (YCoR) (aged 14-18 years), aimed to explore the experiences, psychological characteristics and interactions of CYP engaging with an online peer-peer message board service to explore theoretical and methodological approaches to examine such ‘real world’ data and inform service evaluation. Incorporating contextualised interpretations of the YCoR, a phenomenological approach explored how the experiences of abuse were constructed and questioned by CYP in online texts, and what motivates help-seeking.

E000D-FF6-9AD,The Chinese version of the Maltreatment and Abuse Chronology of Exposure (MACE) scale: Psychometric properties in a sample of young adults,"There are several effective self-report instruments used by Chinese researchers to retrospectively assess exposure to childhood maltreatment. However, these measures do not assess the timing of exposure, restricting efforts to identify periods of development when childhood maltreatment maximally increases vulnerability to psychopathology. In the current study we created a Chinese version of the Maltreatment and Abuse Chronology of Exposure (MACE) scale, which assesses multiplicity (number of types of maltreatment experienced) and severity of maltreatment as well as when it occurred during childhood and adolescence. Rasch modeling was used for scale development in a sample of 812 undergraduate students. Item reduction analysis of the original 75 items used to develop the 52-item MACE produced a 58-item Chinese version. The new scale showed the same factor structure as the original MACE, good three-week test-retest reliability, and good convergent validity with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) and the revised Adverse Childhood Experiences Questionnaire (ACEQ-R). Variance decomposition analyses found that compared to the CTQ and ACE, the MACE Severity and Multiplicity scores explained higher variance in self-reported depression and anxiety symptom ratings on the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS). The results of the present study confirmed that the Chinese version of the MACE has sound psychometric properties in the Chinese cultural context. This new instrument will be a valuable tool for Chinese researchers to study retrospective reports of the type and timing of exposure to maltreatment.",2021-09-25T11:50:44.818242+00:00,"type and timing,psychometrics.,chinese version,questionnaire,maltreatment and abuse chronology of exposure (mace) scale",,,"Zhiyin Wu, Jianjun Zhu, Yuanyuan Chen, Xiaoyu Zheng, Zhen Wang",psyarxiv
E024A-B7A-FD4,Multinomial Logistic Regression Model of Demographic Predictors and Confounders of Binge Alcohol Use among Adults with Major Depression,"Identifying sociodemographic populations with a major depressive episode (MDE) who are at increased risk for binge alcohol use (BAU) is critical for developing focused prevention programs to meet the particular needs of each population. Thus, the goal of the current exploratory retrospective study is to examine sex, race, age, education, marital status, and income as risk predictors for BAU among adults with MDE; and if the risk for BAU changes after adjusting for demographic confounders. To achieve the study goal, data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s 2018 National Survey for Drug Use and Health were extracted and analyzed. The unweighted sample included 6,999 adults representing a weighted population size of 33,900,452.122 in the US. Results revealed that age and marital status significantly predicted BAU in the past month among adults with MDE. Adults under the age of 50, with a college degree, never married, divorced/separated, and with a high-middle income level or higher were at higher risk for BAU. The study's clinical implications are that understanding demographics of individuals with MDE at increased risk for BAU can inform improved tailored assessment and treatment of alcohol abuse and MDE among at-risk populations. Future research should consider examining additional potential risk factors for BAU among adults with MDE.",2021-05-09T23:01:58.002645+00:00,"demographic predictors,binge alcohol use,adjustment for confounders,complex survey design,major depressive episode",,,Areen Omary,psyarxiv
E0141-795-047,Differences in Perceptions of Intimate Partner Violence Between Professionals and Nonprofessionals,"Intimate partner violence (IPV) is prevalent and harmful, yet many are unable to recognize violence or do not take it seriously. To address this, people with professional expertise in IPV are working to educate the public, often through public education campaigns and other prevention efforts. However, disconnects can exist between what professionals and the public perceive as violence. The current research sought to gain a deeper understanding of how professionals and nonprofessionals differ in their perceptions of IPV. We recruited participants with and without professional expertise in IPV and asked them to categorize a series of behaviors (e.g., “Justin(e)'s partner did not let him/her make decisions”) as either abusive or not abusive. We manipulated the gender of the survivor and did not clearly state the gender of the perpetrator. We found that professionals, in comparison to nonprofessionals, categorized higher proportions of physically, psychologically, and sexually abusive behaviors as abusive. The gender of the survivor was not associated with categorizations of abuse. We discuss specific behaviors which professionals and nonprofessionals categorized most differently; for example, significantly more professionals than nonprofessionals categorized “Justin(e)'s partner insisted that they have sex” as abusive. These findings contribute to the wider literature on perceptions of abuse and have implications for improving efforts to prevent intimate partner violence.",2023-03-28T13:12:31.836869+00:00,,,,"Nicolyn Charlot, Samantha Joel",psyarxiv
E004C-729-2E8,When Survival Takes the Helm: Trauma Bonding and the Eclipse of Emotion and Logic,"This paper explores the paradoxical dynamics of survival attachment in the context of narcissistic abuse and trauma bonding. It argues that trauma bonding is not a failure of emotion or cognition, but a neurobiological survival imperative that bypasses logic and emotional processing altogether. The paper begins by examining how survival states override conscious thought and reorganize behavior at the level of reflex, grounding trauma bonding in neurological necessity rather than emotional immaturity or cognitive error.
Building on this foundation, the paper introduces the concept of the psychic schism—a clinically significant internal rupture that emerges from this survival override. While dissociation has been widely studied, the psychic schism describes a specific intrapsychic tension between the drive for connection and the imperative for safety under threat. This psychic fragmentation becomes most visible in the aftermath of discard and in the destabilizing silence of “no contact,” where the survival structure collapses and leaves the survivor exposed to internal contradiction and pain.
This framework challenges linear trauma models by emphasizing the strategic internal alignment survivors enact to survive, often at the cost of coherence. It calls for more nuanced therapeutic approaches that account for the dissociative and neurobiological complexity of trauma bonding. Understanding survival attachment as a preconscious override rather than emotional dysfunction opens new pathways for compassion and intervention in abuse recovery.",2025-05-29,"neurotrauma, relational trauma, emotional dysregulation, polyvagal theory, coercive control,trauma bonding, narcissistic abuse, survival attachment, dissociation, psychic schism",,,Charles J.

E01FA-026-57F,Probative or prejudicial: Biasing effects of background information in police body-worn video evidence on mock-juror decisions in victim-depressed domestic abuse cases,"Body-worn videos enable domestic violence complainants’ first statements to be presented to in court to a jury if a complainant declines to attend. Footage of residential incidents might capture information not relevant to issues in dispute, but which might prejudicially influence juries’ fact-finding. The current research examined whether low salience case-irrelevant changes to background information biased mock juror decision-making. Participant mock jurors (n = 1,108) randomly viewed videos, or extracted audio only, depicting a female actor-complainant providing an alleged domestic abuse statement. Videos depicted toddler’s toys, games and sports equipment, a bookcase, or no additional furniture. The defendant’s mitigating statement referred to the complainant as depressed or of low mood. When the complainant was described as depressed, guilty verdict rates were significantly higher when participants heard audio than when they watched footage. Guilty verdict rates were also significantly lower when videos displayed games and sports equipment. Participants’ pre-existing attitudes towards blaming domestic abuse victims mitigated defendant guilt attributions. Higher perpetrator or situational blame aggravated blame. In summary, case-irrelevant background residential information implying different family relationships can influence juror verdicts, demonstrating a risk to trial fairness from extra-legal information presentation. It is important that courts worldwide are aware of this risk.",2019-08-19T20:21:54.408849+00:00,"witness,jury,body-worn video,body-worn camera,domestic abuse,intimate partner violence,victim",,,"Andrew Roberts, Josh P Davis, Carly Smith",psyarxiv
E004E-B2A-A70,Exploring the ownership of child-like sex dolls,"There is a fervent social debate ongoing that relates to the ownership of child-like sex dolls. On the one hand, some proponents of dolls suggest that they offer a safe sexual outlet for minor-attracted people (MAPs) and could be used in efforts to prevent the sexual abuse of children. On the other side of the debate, child-like dolls are seen as articles that sexualize children, encourage deviant fantasies, and increase offending risk. To date, no empirical analyses have been undertaken with people who own such dolls. In this paper we present data from child-like sex doll owners (n = 85) and MAPs who do not own dolls (n = 120). Specifically, we compared their psychological characteristics and proclivities for sexual aggression. Among non-owners, almost 80% of participants declared an interest in owning a sex doll, which is higher than in adult-attracted samples of non-owners. We found few differences between the groups on most personality variables, with doll owners being less antisocial and anxiously-attached than non-owners, but exhibiting more schizotypal traits. Related to offending proclivities, doll ownership was associated with lower levels of sexual preoccupation and self-reported arousal to hypothetical abuse scenarios, but higher levels of sexually objectifying behaviors and anticipated enjoyment of sexual encounters with children. We discuss these data in relation to a functional model of child-like sex doll ownership among MAPs.",2022-02-18T10:09:31.190302+00:00,"pedophilia,minor attraction,forensic psychology,sexual abuse,sexuality,sex science,sex dolls,prevention",,,"Rebecca Lievesley, Craig A.

E0035-10B-137,AI Avatar Tells You What Happened: The First Test of Using AI-Operated Children in Simulated Interviews to Train Investigative Interviewers,"Background: Previous research has shown that simulated child sexual abuse interview training using avatars paired with feedback and modeling improves interview quality. However, in order to make this approach scalable, the classification of interviewer questions needs to be automated. Objective: We tested an automated question classification system for simulated investigative interviews with children while also providing interventions (feedback and modeling) aimed at improving interview quality. Participants and Setting: Forty-two professionals were randomly assigned to the no intervention, feedback, or modeling group. Methods: The participants conducted two simulated child sexual abuse interviews online while receiving no intervention, feedback or modeling after the first interview. Feedback consisted of the outcome of the alleged case and comments on the quality of the questions asked by the interviewer. Modeling consisted of learning points and videos illustrating good and bad questioning methods. Results: The total percentage of agreement in question coding between human operators and the automated classification was 72% for the main categories (recommended vs. not recommended) and 52% when the eleven subcategories were considered. The intervention groups improved from first to second interview while this was not the case in the no intervention group (intervention x time: p = .007, ηp2 = .28). Conclusions: Automated question classification worked well for classifying the interviewers’ questions allowing interventions to improve the quality of the interviews.",2022-08-04T05:55:23.544347+00:00,"feedback,child sexual abuse (csa),simulation training,behavior modeling,artificial intelligence,investigative interviewing",,,"Pekka Santtila, Shumpei Haginoya, Tatsuro Ibe, Shota Yamamoto, Hazuki Mizushi, Naruyo Yoshimoto",psyarxiv
E0108-226-5E0,"The relationship between cognitive processes, self-stigma, and internalizing psychopathology in individuals with a sexual preference for minors","Individuals with a sexual preference for minors are subject to significant stigma in society, even in the absence of any criminal behavior, which can profoundly affect their psychological well-being. This stigma can contribute to the development of internalizing psychopathology (e.g., anxiety, depression, and stress), which is also recognized as dynamic risk factor for child sexual abuse. This cross-sectional questionnaire study (N = 92) aimed to examine the psychological distress experienced by this population. Specifically, we: (1) investigated the occurrence of internalizing complaints among individuals with a sexual preference for minors; (2) examined associations between cognitive processes (e.g., rumination, emotional attentional control), self-stigma, and internalizing psychopathology; and (3) explored the mediating role of rumination, specifically brooding, in linking self-stigma and internalizing psychopathology. The results indicate that individuals with a sexual preference for minors experience significantly higher levels of anxiety, depression, and stress compared to the general population. Furthermore, several hypothesized associations were confirmed, including associations between self-stigma, poor emotional attentional control, brooding and internalizing psychopathology. Mediation analyses further revealed that brooding mediates the effect of self-stigma on internalizing complaints, albeit with small effect sizes. Follow-up longitudinal studies are necessary to validate these findings and explore their implications. Ultimately, these insights aim to inform targeted interventions and support strategies for this population, which could help to prevent child sexual abuse.",2025-03-04T10:04:13.728744+00:00,"internalizing psychopathology,self-stigma,depression,aniety,emotional attentional control,sexual interests in minors,rumination,stress",,,"Kristof Hoorelbeke, Minne De Boeck, Yannick Vander Zwalmen, Ernst H.

E0013-497-42D,Adverse childhood experiences and fronto-subcortical brain structures in YOUth,"The impact of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) differs between individuals and depends on the type and timing of the ACE. The aim of this study was to assess the relation between various recently occurred ACEs and morphology in the developing brain of children between 8 and 11 years of age. We measured subcortical volumes, cortical thickness, cortical surface area and fractional anisotropy in regions of interest in brain scans acquired in 1,184 children from the YOUth cohort. ACEs were based on parent-reports of recent experiences and included: financial problems; parental mental health problems; physical health problems in the family; substance abuse in the family; trouble with police, justice or child protective services; change in household composition; change in housing; bereavement; divorce or conflict in the family; exposure to violence in the family and bullying victimization. We ran separate linear models for each ACE and each brain measure. Results were adjusted for the false discovery rate across regions of interest. ACEs were reported for 83% of children in the past year. Children were on average exposed to two ACEs. Substance abuse in the household was associated with larger cortical surface area in the left superior frontal gyrus, t(781) = 3.724, pFDR = 0.0077, right superior frontal gyrus, t(781) = 3.409, pFDR = 0.0110, left pars triangularis, t(781) = 3.614, pFDR = 0.0077, left rostral middle frontal gyrus, t(781) = 3.163, pFDR = 0.0195 and right caudal anterior cingulate gyrus, t(781) = 2.918, pFDR = 0.0348. Household exposure to violence (was associated with lower fractional anisotropy in the left and right cingulum bundle hippocampus region t(697) = −3.154, pFDR = 0.0101 and t(697) = −3.401, pFDR = 0.0085, respectively. Lower household incomes were more prevalent when parents reported exposure to violence and the mean parental education in years was lower when parents reported substance abuse in the family. No other significant associations with brain structures were found. Longer intervals between adversity and brain measurements and longitudinal measurements may reveal whether more evidence for the impact of ACEs on brain development will emerge later in life.",2022-03-15T14:40:14.281442+00:00,"adverse childhood experiences,brain structure,youth cohort study,neuroimaging,child,stress",,,"Elizabeth Buimer, Pascal Pas, René Mandl, Hugo Schnack, Rachel Brouwer, Hilleke Hulshoff Pol",psyarxiv
E005C-C6F-545,"Swedish and Norwegian police interviewers’ goals, tactics, and emotions when interviewing suspects of child sexual abuse","As the suspect interview is one of the key elements of a police investigation, it has received a great deal of merited attention from the scientific community. However, suspect interviews in child sexual abuse (CSA) investigations is an understudied research area. In the present mixed-methods study, we examine Swedish (n = 126) and Norwegian (n = 52) police interviewers’ self-reported goals, tactics, and emotional experiences when conducting interviews with suspected CSA offenders. The quantitative analyses found associations between the interviewers’ self-reported goals, tactics, and emotions during these types of suspect interviews. Interviewers who reported experiencing more negative emotions were more likely to employ confrontational tactics. Specifically, anger was positively associated with the goal of obtaining a confession and with aggressive tactics like raising one’s voice and emphasizing the seriousness of the crime. Frustration and disgust displayed similar patterns. Somewhat contrasting these quantitative results, the thematic analysis identified a strong consensus that emotions should not and do not affect the police interviewers’ work. Furthermore, the police interviewers described a range of strategies for managing emotions during the interview and for processing their emotional reactions afterwards. The present findings highlight the relevance of emotional processes in CSA suspect interviews and provide an initial exploration of the potentially complex relationship between the goals, tactics, and emotional experiences of police interviewers who question CSA suspects.",2020-09-21T10:48:20.022694+00:00,"suspect,investigative interview,interrogation,emotion,norway,goals,sweden,child sexual abuse,tactics,police",,,"Timothy J.

E0167-D22-50B,Intra- and interpersonal emotion regulation are altered in individuals with childhood maltreatment: Cross-sectional associations and effects on daily life mood,"Childhood maltreatment (CM) is associated with deficits in intrapersonal ER (regulating emotions internally), whereas the role of interpersonal ER (seeking support from others to regulate emotions) remains unclear. We explored the CM-ER association in two studies. Data and code are available at https://osf.io/cbkyj/. Study 1 tested pre-registered hypotheses (https://osf.io/2kt35) on the association between CM and self-reported ER difficulties in a web-based sample (N=553). Results replicated a positive association between CM severity and intrapersonal ER difficulties and revealed differential effects of abuse versus neglect. Additionally, CM was associated with lower use of and more difficulties in interpersonal ER. For study 2, we re-analyzed an ambulatory assessment dataset (N=103) with six pseudo-randomized daily assessments over seven days (3,973 observations). In exploratory analyses, we tested whether ER predicted negative mood in the context of interpersonal stressors, beyond any effects of CM. Results showed that difficulties in intra- but not interpersonal ER predicted a more negative momentary mood in the context of interpersonal stressors (above any effect of CM severity), which underlines intrapersonal ER as a treatment target with likely daily life consequences. We discuss the reduced use of interpersonal ER in CM in light of recent findings on trust in individuals with CM.",2025-06-04,"ambulatory assessment,child abuse,child neglect,childhood adversity,ecological momentary assessment,emotional regulation",,,"Sara Elena Schmitz, Johanna Hepp, Michelle Langenstein, Inga Niedtfeld",psyarxiv
E00BE-730-C5E,"Empathy for Human and Non-Human Animal Pain: How Species Categorization, Pain Cues, and Psychosocial Traits Shape Pain Perception and Prosocial Intentions","Empathy for pain guides moral concern and prosocial behaviour, yet little is known about how it extends across species. This study examined how people perceive and respond to pain in humans, pets, and farmed animals, and how these responses relate to individual psychosocial traits. We developed and validated the Cross-Species Pain Empathy Task (C-SPET), the first image-based tool enabling direct comparison of pain perception and willingness to help across species. A total of 407 undergraduate participants rated perceived pain and support intentions after viewing images of wounded (pain) and non-wounded (no-pain) individuals from each species category. Participants reported greater willingness to help animals than humans, possibly due to perceptions of animals as more vulnerable. Within the animal category, when no pain was visible, farmed animals were perceived as suffering more and received more support than pets. Awareness of the typical living conditions of farmed animals may lead people to infer suffering even in the absence of pain cues. When pain was explicit, pets were perceived as suffering more and received more support than farmed animals. Pain cues may have triggered either emotional closeness toward pets or cognitive dissonance in response to farmed animal suffering, as this challenged participants’ everyday practices such as meat consumption. Canonical correlation analyses revealed two psychosocial profiles linked to pain sensitivity and prosocial intentions. A caring, pro-animal profile was associated with greater support for non-human animals. A second profile, reflecting emotional reactivity, religiosity, and cultural background, was linked to heightened pain sensitivity across species. Species-specific biases were shaped by distinct traits. Favouring animals over humans was associated with pro-animal attitudes, life choices, and lower prejudice, possibly reflecting a strategic moral prioritisation of often neglected groups. Favouring pets over farmed animals was linked to ethnicity, higher meat consumption, political conservatism, and social dominance orientation, suggesting a tendency to maintain traditional roles around animal categories. These findings highlight the psychosocial factors that shape pain empathy and caring behaviour across species.",2025-07-10,"Attitudes Toward Animals,Canonical Correlation Analysis,Empathy,Human-Animal,Human-Animal Relationships,Individual Differences,Non-Human Animals,Pain,Pain Empathy,Pain Perception,Pain in Others,Prosocial Behaviour,Social Cognition",,,"Marina López-Solà, Brock Bastian, Maria Sunol",psyarxiv
E00EC-6A3-D04,Cloned voices are easier to understand in noise than their human originals: the voice cloning intelligibility benefit,"Voice cloning technology has developed at an extremely rapid pace and recent work suggests the quality of synthesis now produces humanlike voices. Recent research on cloned voices focused on listeners’ capabilities to discriminate between cloned, ‘deepfake’ and human voices, due to perils associated with the misuse of this technology. However, the relative intelligibility of cloned and human voices is unknown. We compared the relative intelligibility ten human voices with their ten clones in background noise. Participants (N=80) listened to 80 sentences, 40 human and 40 cloned in +3dB, 0dB, -3dB and -6dB signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) in an online experiment. We found that cloned voices were more intelligible in noise than their human counterparts; up to 20% higher across all four noise levels. We also asked participants to rate the clarity and accent strength of all human and cloned voices; and asked participants to identify which voice was human in an 2AFC task. The cloned voices were rated as having marginally higher clarity and perceived to have a less standard accent. Participants identified the human voices with ~70% accuracy. The acoustic analysis of both types of voices revealed that the intelligibility benefit was linked to voice source characteristics including mean pitch and period variation, plus a smoother voice source and improved harmonic-to-noise ratio in the 500-3500 frequency range in the cloned voices. Our results have implications for applications of cloned voices, such as voice restoration, speech synthesis for non-verbal people, and for people with hearing loss.",2025-08-16,,,,"patti adank, Han Wang",psyarxiv
E01CE-B8D-28F,Polygamous Interest in a Mononormative Nation: The Roles of Sex and Sociosexuality in Polygamous Interest in a Heterosexual Sample From the UK,"Polygamy is a form of “one-sided” consensually non-monogamous relationship where one person has multiple committed partners, each of whom is only involved with that one person. It was likely a reoccurring feature of ancestral mating that posed adaptive problems for our ancestors. Yet polygamy, and multi-partnering more generally, is understudied in Western cultures, raising questions about the existence of polygamous interest and whether this is calibrated adaptively to personal condition. In two studies, we examined polygamous interest in two heterosexual online samples from the UK. In Study 1 (n = 393), modest interest was found for polygamous relationships overall. Men were six times more open to polygyny than women, but there was little sex difference in openness to polyandry. Further analysis revealed that all forms of multi-partnering were undesirable relative to singlehood and monogamy; however, consensual multi-partner relationships were less undesirable than non-consensual ones. Sex differences were largest for polygyny and arrangements where men had agreed access to a casual partner alongside a committed one, yet these were two of the most acceptable forms of multi-partnering when men and women’s responses were combined. Sociosexuality positively predicted interest in most forms of multi-partnering. Study 2 (n = 735) focused on polygyny and added status-linked traits as predictors. The results of Study 1 were broadly replicated, though the status-linked traits did not predict polygynous interest specifically. Instead, sociosexuality and male intrasexual competitiveness uniquely predicted general interest in multi-partner relationships. Overall, interest in polygamy appears to emerge despite social discouragement, and sex differences in interest track the relative costs and benefits associated with it. However, there is no strong evidence that polygamous interest is uniquely calibrated to personal condition when compared to other forms of multi-partnering.",2022-07-06T10:05:00.894891+00:00,"evolutionary psychology,polygyny,sex differences,polyandry,sociosexuality,consensual non-monogamy",,,"Steve Stewart-Williams, Sophie Harrison, Andrew G.

E0065-7B8-C5E,The internalization of social stigma among minor-attracted persons: Implications for treatment,"In this paper, we sought to build on existing stigmatization research by examining the extent to which internalized stigmatization (i.e., the personal adoption and incorporation of social views, operationalized as thought suppression – an avoidant coping strategy – and low psychological wellbeing) among minor-attracted persons (MAPs) may impact upon help-seeking behaviors and their avoidance of children. We adopted a cross-sectional anonymous survey design to recruit a sample of self-identified MAPs (N = 183) from prominent online support fora. We found that increased levels of suppression and lower levels of psychological wellbeing were associated with lower levels of hope about the future, but higher levels of both shame and guilt about having a sexual interest in minors. Thought suppression was not significantly associated with outcomes related to help-seeking behaviors, but did significantly higher rates of actively avoiding children, even after controlling for psychological wellbeing and other emotional variables. Independently, lower levels of self-reported psychological wellbeing was associated with a desire for more support and higher rates of actively avoiding children. We explore the potential implications of our data in relation to treating and supporting MAPs within the community, increasing their wellbeing, and encouraging help-seeking behavior.

E0055-A78-D83,"Ketamine in severe, highly treatment-resistant depression—a retrospective case study and a perspective","Ketamine is a well-known and widely available general anesthetic from the 1960s that, in sub-anesthetic doses, has been adopted in a limited manner for the treatment of acute suicidality and treatment-resistant depression. Its short onset time and short duration of action make it feasible for use at outpatient clinics. In the US, it has a long history of off-label use and was officially approved for depression treatment in 2019. In Finland, it has been administered to selected hospitalized patients in the public healthcare system since 2010 and became available at a private outpatient clinic very recently. In Norway, it has been administered off-label at a private clinic for approximately 500 patients since mid-2010s and at a public clinic for approximately 300 patients since 2020, with plans on opening more clinics in 2024. In the US, the treatment has been administered to hundreds of thousands of patients. The retrospective ethnographic inquiry part of this study features a Finnish woman in her twenties who suffered from treatment-resistant depression, rooted in her insecure childhood and having been bullied at school, as well as income insecurity and excessive workload in adulthood. Eventually, she was violently raped, which induced an obvious post-traumatic stress disorder and exacerbated her depression, incapacitating her. In the course of approximately five years, she was prescribed ten different anti-depressive medications and seventeen other medications, including various antipsychotic medications and lithium. These failed to provide an anti-depressive effect but resulted in 'massive' adverse effects instead, including 60% weight gain and psychotic hallucinations. Eventually, esketamine spray treatment at a private outpatient clinic resolved her depression in a single session. A weekly re-administration process was ongoing. In this case, repeated esketamine administration alleviated depression by producing accumulating corrective emotional experiences without the need to re-experience previous traumatizing events. In a few months to a year, the transient but accumulating anti-depressive effect typically leads to the resolution of depression in most cases, if the patients' living conditions no longer constantly re-traumatize them. It is necessary to adopt ketamine more widely as an emergency measure while more effective, non-addictive alternatives and complements are prepared for adoption. The cost of this specific pilot program implementation was unscalable, but costs can be reduced by approximately 90% by modifying the implementation details. Ketamine and its more effective alternative, 5-MeO-DMT, can serve a major role in facilitating a rebirth of public and private mental healthcare systems, with treatment efficacy multiplied and treatment costs simultaneously reduced.",2024-06-07T06:12:11.320422+00:00,"5-meo-dmt,psychedelics,childhood abuse,malpractice,c-ptsd,ketamine,psychedelic therapy,esketamine,depression",,,Mika Turkia,psyarxiv
E00D6-5B2-240,Betrayed? That’s me: Implicit and explicit betrayed self-concept in young adults abused as children,"Attenuated awareness of betrayal, or “betrayal blindness,” is a proposed survival mechanism in relationships where awareness of betrayal will mobilize confront-or-withdraw responses that jeopardize a needed relationship. Empirical tests of betrayal blindness and its effects are hampered by the methodological conundrum of how to measure an absence of awareness. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the validity of a novel empirical method to measure implicit betrayed self-concept, the first step in a long-term research aim to operationalize “betrayal blindness.” Informed by betrayal trauma theory, we hypothesized that a history of betrayal within close childhood relationships (but not recent close relationships or “not-close” relationships) would predict implicit betrayed-self associations in young adulthood. We designed an adaptation of the Implicit Association Test (IAT) and measured implicit and explicit betrayed- self associations and self-reported history of physical, sexual, and psychological abuse in 529 university undergraduates. Internal consistency reliability of the betrayed self IAT was low but adequate. Hierarchical regression modeling revealed that history of abuse within close childhood relationships (but not recent close relationships or “not-close” relationships) predicted betrayed- self IAT scores. The effect size was small, β = .12, p &lt; .05, 95% CI [.01, .07], R2 = .12. In addition, history of betrayal by someone close (but not someone “not close”) at any age predicted increased explicit evaluations of the self as betrayed versus respected, a small effect size, R2 = .16. Findings indicate that implicit betrayed self-concept can be measured empirically.",2019-05-21T16:10:50.813250+00:00,"self-concept,implicit association test (iat),implicit cognition,measurement,implicit association test,adult survivor,child abuse,iat,trauma",,,"Jennifer J.

Methods: Repeated individual qualitative interviews were conducted with pregnant mothers and fathers who reported DVA and were taking part in a psychological intervention to address DVA. Interviews were carried out at the start (during pregnancy) and end of the intervention (two years post-childbirth). Reflexive Thematic Analysis was used to analyse interviews. Results: 56 interviews (26 mothers; 13 fathers) were analysed. Five themes were identified: (1) Acknowledging childhood experiences of DVA; (2) The scars of traumatic experiences; (3) Challenging the silencing of abuse; (4) The transmission of parenting styles and behaviours from one generation to another; (5) Becoming the best parent one can be. Ninety-one percent of the participants providing information on their childhood family environment experienced at least one adverse childhood experience (ACE) and the intergenerational transmission of violence was identifiable in most narratives. Despite this, several participants described skills they acquired during the intervention (e.g., emotional regulation strategies) as assisting in interrupting violence and improving their relationships with their children. Conclusions: Participants with at least one ACE identified it as one of several risk factors for DVA in adulthood and how the intergenerational transmission of violence and poor parenting practices may be mitigated through trauma-informed, targeted interventions.",2023-04-21T12:21:44.525432+00:00,,,,"Debra Bick, Federica Taccini, Nicky Stanley, Kylee Trevillion, Sarah Byford, Stefania Mannarini, Josephine Ocloo, Margaret Heslin, Harriet MacMillan, Louise Howard, Jill Domoney, Paul G.

E0126-E9E-362,"5-MeO-DMT in the complete resolution of the consequences of chronic, severe sexual abuse in early childhood—a retrospective case study","5-MeO-DMT is a psychedelic substance with a short duration of action and intensive effects. Its therapeutic efficacy and practicality may significantly surpass those of classical psychedelics such as ayahuasca and LSD. This retrospective ethnographic inquiry features a woman in her mid-thirties who witnessed her mother's violent suicide and its bloody aftermath at the age of three. Before and after that, her childhood was characterized by domestic violence and sexual abuse perpetrated by several members of her family and extended family. In her twenties and thirties, she dated a member of the local mafia with the intention of asking him to kill her father, who had been the main perpetrator of the sexual abuse and violence. This plan was eventually not carried out, but it reflected her deep bitterness and wrath. A process initiated in her early thirties involving four 5-MeO-DMT sessions and a few additional sessions with psilocybin and ayahuasca in the course of two years completely resolved her symptoms related to the abuses, to the extent that she could rebuild a functional relationship with her father and feel love and compassion towards him. This outcome, i.e., the complete reversal of her attitude and emotions towards her father, appeared highly unusual. For the last three years, the outcome had remained stable. The article also presents the perspective of a female facilitator of this treatment process. The article contributes to a better understanding of the use of 5-MeO-DMT in severe traumatization as well as exemplifies the possible positive contributions of actors who are not medical professionals in resolving deep collective traumatization in societies.",2024-06-07T06:28:34.761514+00:00,"psilocybin,psychedelic therapy,rape,bufo,5-meo-dmt,reactivation,ayahuasca,domestic violence,psychedelics,nonduality,ptsd,c-ptsd,childhood sexual abuse",,,Mika Turkia,psyarxiv
E00B3-D36-1FC,Measuring Childhood Adversity: Psychometric Challenges and a Novel Scoring Proposal based on a Nationally Representative Study in Serbia,"Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are robust predictors of later mental and physical health problems, yet methodological inconsistencies in their measurement complicate prevalence estimates and cross-cultural comparisons. The present study provides the first nationally representative data on ACEs in Serbia while critically examining current scoring practices and proposing a novel normalized scoring system. Data were collected from a stratified national sample of adults in Serbia using the ACE-International Questionnaire (ACE-IQ; WHO, 2018). Thirteen ACE domains were assessed with binary and scaled items. Prevalence was calculated using two recommended WHO scoring methods (binary and frequency), and a new normalized scoring approach in which each domain was rescaled to a 0–1 range. Criterion validity was tested against trauma-related symptoms and physical health outcomes. Prevalence estimates varied dramatically depending on the scoring method: physical abuse was reported by 50.2% (binary) versus 7.8% (frequency), and emotional abuse by 78.8% versus 23.9%. Binary scoring suggested that over half of respondents experienced four or more ACEs, while frequency scoring indicated that 37% reported none. The normalized scoring approach produced more nuanced distributions and showed consistent associations with both trauma symptoms and health outcomes, particularly respiratory and neurological problems. Findings underscore the need for standardized ACE scoring methods. The proposed normalized approach enhances psychometric clarity, facilitates cross-cultural comparability, and improves the utility of ACE assessment for epidemiological research, clinical practice, and public health interventions.",2025-09-27,,,,"Marija Mitkovic Voncina, Oliver Toskovic, Lili Lazarevic, Milica Pejovic Milovancevic",psyarxiv
E020C-A6D-628,"Sour Sleep, Sweet Revenge? Aggressive Pleasure as a Potential Mechanism Underlying Poor Sleep Quality’s Link to Aggression","Sleep quality is a critical component of successful human functioning. Poor sleep quality is associated with aggressive behavior, yet the psychological mechanisms that drive this effect are incompletely understood. We tested the prediction that the association between poor sleep quality and aggression would be explained, in part, by a magnified experience of positive affect during aggression. We conducted two cross-sectional studies (Study 1 N = 388; Study 2: N = 317) and a third preregistered study (N = 379), which tested for mediation across two waves that were separated by 14-42 days. Across all three studies, we replicated the positive association between poor sleep quality and aggression. However, we did not observe compelling or consistent evidence that poor sleep quality is linked to greater positive affect during aggression. Such aggressive pleasure was temporally-stable and predicted subsequent increases in aggressive behavior. These findings support a reinforcement model of aggressive affect, in which the pleasure of aggression promotes greater aggression over time ‒ perhaps explaining why some individuals are more dispositionally-aggressive than others.",2019-01-30T19:10:59.093583+00:00,"pleasure,social rejection,sleep quality,affect,aggression",,,"David Chester, Joseph Dzierzewski",psyarxiv
E0064-269-1FF,Digital Content Modalities and Adolescent Mental Health: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Video versus Non-Video Platform Effects,"Background: Rising adolescent mental health concerns have paralleled the proliferation of multimodal digital platforms, with short-form video consumption reaching unprecedented levels. Current research aggregates diverse social media platforms, potentially obscuring content-specific psychological mechanisms that may differentially impact mental health outcomes.

Objectives: To systematically examine how different digital content modalities (text, image, video) affect adolescent mental health outcomes, with particular focus on the psychological mechanisms linking short-form video platforms to anxiety and depression.

Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines. Electronic databases (PsychINFO, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus) were searched for studies published 2020-2024 examining digital content consumption and adolescent mental health. Inclusion criteria required adolescent participants (10-19 years), validated mental health measures, and content modality specification. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed using Cohen's d and odds ratios, with subgroup analyses by content type.

Results: Forty-seven studies met inclusion criteria (N=156,789 participants). Short-form video platforms showed significantly stronger associations with mental health outcomes (pooled d=0.45, 95% CI: 0.32-0.58) compared to image-based platforms (d=0.28, 95% CI: 0.18-0.38) and text-based platforms (d=0.21, 95% CI: 0.12-0.30). Video content demonstrated unique psychological pathways including enhanced parasocial relationships (d=0.35), intensified social comparison (d=0.48), and algorithm-driven attention disruption (d=0.33). Longitudinal studies revealed accelerated symptom development among video platform users compared to other modalities.

Conclusions: Digital content modality significantly influences adolescent mental health outcomes, with video platforms creating distinct psychological risks requiring targeted interventions. Current aggregated approaches to social media research may substantially underestimate video-specific effects. Clinical assessment and prevention programs should differentiate content modalities in their approaches.

Firstly, I will explore the literature on adverse childhood experiences, focussing on aspects such as critical periods of development, responsivity to stress, neural plasticity and the importance of family, to establish the potential effects on children’s social development, educational attainment, behavioural system, physical system and neurological development. Secondly, by exploring emotion regulation and the biological mechanisms that regulate the body’s stress hormone response system, I aim to identify how the association between stress and empathy impact the behavioural and emotional systems, to establish whether reduced empathy development is a potential pathway to future psychotic disorders, particularly, within populations with a history of childhood maltreatment. Finally, I will investigate how the court conducts family contact disputes, maintaining a balance between participation and protection of the child, whilst retaining the equilibrium of these views and the welfare principle.",2020-11-09T14:00:36.019963+00:00,"family court,stress,adverse childhood experiences,child contact orders,scottish family court,empathy,neglect and abuse",,,Elaine Jackson,psyarxiv
E003E-383-A27,Stress reactivity as a putative mechanism linking childhood trauma with clinical outcomes in individuals at ultra-high risk for psychosis: Findings from the EU-GEI High Risk Study,"Childhood trauma is associated with an elevated risk for psychosis, but the psychological mechanisms involved remain largely unclear. This study aimed to investigate emotional and psychotic stress reactivity in daily life as a putative mechanism linking childhood trauma and clinical outcomes in individuals at ultra-high risk (UHR) for psychosis. Experience sampling methodology was used to measure momentary stress, affect and psychotic experiences in the daily life of N=79 UHR individuals in the EU-GEI High Risk study. The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire was used to assess self-reported childhood trauma. Clinical outcomes were assessed at baseline, 1- and 2-year follow-up. The association of stress with positive (β=-0.14, P=.010) and negative affect (β=0.11, P=.020) was modified by transition status such that stress reactivity was greater in individuals who transitioned to psychosis. Moreover, the association of stress with negative affect (β=0.06, P=.019) and psychotic experiences (β=0.05, P=.037) was greater in individuals exposed to high vs. low levels of childhood trauma. We also found evidence that decreased positive affect in response to stress was associated with reduced functioning at 1-year follow-up (B=6.29, P=.034). In addition, there was evidence that the association of childhood trauma with poor functional outcomes was mediated by stress reactivity (e.g. Bindirect effect =-2.13, P=.026), but no evidence that stress reactivity mediated the association between childhood trauma and transition (e.g. Bindirect effect=0.14, P=.506).

E00C9-B27-DCC,Prevalence of Cannabis Use Disorder: A Meta-Analysis of Population Surveys,"Objective: Epidemiologic surveys aim to estimate the population prevalence of cannabis use and cannabis use disorder. Prevalences estimates are important for understanding trends, such as the impact of policy change. Existing epidemiologic surveys have produced discrepant and potentially unreliable estimates. The current meta-analysis (PROSPERO CRD42022364818) aims to identify potential sources of unreliability in prevalence estimates of cannabis use and use disorder among the general population (aged 12+). There was no specific hypothesis about overall prevalence estimate, but we expected significant variability (i.e., heterogeneity) in estimates based on factors such as country, year of data collection, and specific methodological factors (e.g., diagnostic instrument). Method: Systematic searches identified manuscripts and reports documenting nationally representative lifetime or past-year cannabis use disorder prevalence estimates. Meta-analysis was used to synthesize prevalence estimates, evaluate heterogeneity, and test moderators. Results: There were 39 manuscripts/reports included in analyses which resulted in 259 unique prevalence estimates spanning 1980-2013 and an aggregated sample size of 973,281 individuals. Past-year and lifetime prevalence estimates for cannabis use were 12.83% (95% CI: 11.15%, 14.71%) and 38.31% (95% CI: 35.92%, 40.76%) and those for cannabis use disorder were 2.59% (95% CI:2.30%, 2.90%) and 6.77% (95% CI: 4.89%, 9.30%), respectively. There was significant heterogeneity in estimates, which was partially explained by factors such as country, year of data collection, and methodological characteristics. Conclusions: The significant heterogeneity in prevalence estimates as a function of methodological characteristics raises concerns about the generalizability of estimates.

E0094-171-237,Ayahuasca in the treatment of bipolar disorder with psychotic features–A retrospective case study,"Ayahuasca is a plant-based brew of indigenous Amazonian origin. It has psychedelic, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, cytotoxic, and anti-parasitic effects, which are primarily due to monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT). This article describes the case of a woman in her late thirties with complex trauma due to severe, years-long sexual abuse in early childhood, resulting in a decades-long chronic condition involving suicidality. She was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder, but refused to accept either of them. She presented with delusional parasitosis and deep dissociation. Despite being severely psychotic in private, she appeared high-functioning in public, hiding most of her symptoms. In her mid-thirties, she participated in an ayahuasca ceremony in a legal setting. It resolved her suicidality, eliminated her social isolation, and reduced her shame related to her early trauma. Nine more ceremonies alleviated her distress further. Her abuser also participated in an ayahuasca ceremony and confirmed her memories of childhood abuse. The first interview was conducted 1.5 years after her first ceremony, and a follow-up interview 2.5 years later. She had experienced sixteen additional ceremonies, recognized the validity of her bipolar disorder diagnosis, and believed her early trauma to be its sole cause. Her core trauma remained partially unresolved, but her dissociative symptoms continued to decrease. She had observed several other instances of psychosis and bipolar disorder in which ayahuasca had resulted in positive effects. This case study contributes to a better understanding of the use of ayahuasca in bipolar disorder and severe traumatization. It also reviews the current state-of-the-art in the treatment of bipolar disorder using low-dose ayahuasca, and a case in which bipolar disorder was resolved with LSD.",2023-03-10T13:17:41.771333+00:00,"c-ptsd,psychedelics,psychedelic therapy,delusional parasitosis,childhood sexual abuse,psychosis,lsd,ayahuasca,bipolar disorder",,,Mika Turkia,psyarxiv
E00DD-55E-46B,Underground small-group therapy of treatment-resistant depression and complex post-traumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD) with psilocybin—A retrospective case study,"While a relatively large body of research exists on many aspects of psychedelic therapy, articles describing a complete, successful treatment process are rarely found. This article therefore presents a case of a woman in her early forties with early complex trauma due to domestic violence, sexual abuse and poverty in her childhood, resulting in approximately three decades of treatment resistant depression. Antidepressive medications did not alleviate her depression but resulted in adverse effects and an eventual discontinuation of the medications. Eventually the woman resorted to 'mixed-method' underground small-group sessions that utilized breathing exercises, cold exposure, physical exercises, music, and psilocybin mushrooms. Psilocybin appeared to interrupt trauma-related dissociation, producing an 'anti-dissociative' effect, allowing the woman to re-experience, in a controlled setting, dissociated physical sensations produced by earlier overwhelming events. After a period of approximately 1.5 years, during which time she had six psilocybin sessions, either individually, in the small group, or with friends, she achieved a remission of her depression. A follow-up interview 2.5 years later indicated permanence of the result. Information was acquired from semi-structured retrospective interviews with a total duration of approximately eight hours. This case study may facilitate an improved understanding of the requirements for and the process of alleviating or resolving treatment-resistant depression with psychedelics. Recent clinical trials have utilized one or two doses of psilocybin. This case illustrates the need for adopting a multi-dose strategy over an extended period of time in order to achieve remission.",2023-03-10T15:11:38.612365+00:00,"c-ptsd,psilocybin,psychedelic therapy,treatment-resistant depression,domestic violence,hypnotherapy,childhood sexual abuse,psychedelics",,,Mika Turkia,psyarxiv
E018B-B76-BF3,Do Adverse Childhood Experience and Age Predispose Youths to Substance Use?,"Introduction: There are overwhelming evidence on the negative impacts of substance abuse on youth. However, there is paucity of literature on the scenario that adverse childhood experience and age could influence substance use among Nigeria youths. This study investigated whether adverse childhood experience and age could predispose youths to substance use. Methods: A cross-sectional survey design was adopted with a pack questionnaire to collect data from 599 participants containing demographic factors, Adverse childhood experience Questionnaire (CTQ) and Drug Abuse Screening Test-20 (DAST-20). Results: Present finding showed that adverse childhood experience (ACE) had significant difference on substance use (t(394)=13.64; p&lt;.001). Participants with high ACE ( = 46.21, SD = 04.75) exhibited higher substance use than those with low ACE ( = 35.90, SD = 09.56). Also, age has significant influence on substance use (F (2, 597) = 5.511, p&lt;.05). further analysis showed that there is a significant difference between those in the early age (n= 418) and middle age (n = 32) with a total adjusted mean of 26.0, compared to participants within the age range of 18-24years who had adjusted mean difference of 19.7, while participants within the age range of 32-40years (n=150) had adjusted mean difference of 5.72 compared with participants within the age range of 25-31years who had a total adjusted mean of 19.7. Discussion and Conclusions: The study revealed that ACE and age did predisposed youths to substance use; to prevent substance use stakeholders should ameliorate ACEs and manage late adolescence among youths.",2020-04-17T13:56:37.581723+00:00,"age,adverse childhood experience,youth,kano,substance use",,,"'Remi Sunday Opayemi, Rotimi Oguntayo, OYELEKE JOHNSON TUNDE",psyarxiv

Methods: A prospective survey was conducted online between April 2th 2020 and July 5th 2020. Female respondents were recruited from social media networks using the snowball sampling method. Data were collected three times: during (2-19 April) and at the end (11-25 May) of the first lockdown, and following the first lockdown (20 June – 05 July). Sociodemographic variables, lockdown living conditions, financial impact of COVID, and history of psychiatric disorder were evaluated, together with changes in psychological distress over the lockdown period, and the risk of being assaulted post lockdown. Results: Psychological distress was elevated and remained stable for most of the 1538 female respondents during lockdown. More than 7% of women were affected by physical or sexual violence post lockdown. Unwanted sexual contact accounted for the majority of abuse, but physical and sexual assault were also prevalent. The risk of being abused was higher for participants who had changed anxiety/insomnia symptoms over the lockdown period, and a history of abuse. Discussion: Women who experienced changes in anxiety/insomnia symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown were at higher risk than others of being assaulted post lockdown, especially when they were already socially vulnerable.

However, previous studies examining the relationship between SLEs and depression have been limited by focusing on single events, combining events into broad categories, and/or ignoring interrelationships between events in statistical analyses. To surpass these limitations, we applied network analysis using mixed graphical models combining two large-scale population-based samples and more than 34,600 randomly sampled adults to investigate the associations between SLEs and current depressive symptoms in the general population. We identified numerous SLEs which were uniquely associated with specific symptoms. Strong pairwise links were observed between SLEs during the past year and individual symptoms, for example between having experienced illness or injury and sleeping problems, having been degraded or humiliated and feeling blue, and between financial problems and hopelessness and being worried and anxious. Several SLEs, such as financial problems, sexual abuse, and having been degraded or humiliated, were associated with symptoms across more than one timepoint, i.e., when events had occurred during the past year, past 1-5 years, and/or more than 5 years ago. More recent SLEs were generally more strongly associated with depressive symptoms. Several life events were strongly interrelated, such as multiple forms of abuse, and financial problems, unemployment, divorce, and serious illness or injury. Our findings point to the importance of assessing individual SLE exposures of importance for depressive symptoms and may have implications for public health efforts seeking to improve population mental health.",2023-06-21T08:10:12.124605+00:00,"population mental health.,stressful life events,depressive symptoms,network analysis",,,"Omid V.

E020C-5AF-585,Supporting Parents Affected by Childhood Adversity: Embedding a Trauma-Informed Parenting Program in an Urban School District Serving High Poverty Communities,"Introduction: Programs that build parenting skills and confidence can prevent the intergenerational transmission of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and promote positive childhood experiences (PCEs). However, they can be stigmatizing and difficult to access in under-resourced communities. We explored whether a trauma-informed parenting program offered universally in public schools in high-poverty urban communities can engage and support parents who have experienced multiple ACEs. Methods: Parents participating in an evidence-based parenting program (Chicago Parent Program; CPP) offered universally in their child’s school completed measures of their ACEs, PCEs, and perceptions of program satisfaction and impact. CPP session attendance and group-leader ratings of parent engagement in CPP sessions were also obtained. Data were analyzed using descriptive and correlational statistics. Results: Parents (N=230; 82.6% mothers, 67.4% Black/African American, 52.8% with incomes &lt; $20,000) reported high levels of childhood adversity; 53.5% reported four or more ACEs, including witnessing violence (58.8%), physical (48%) and emotional (45.3%) abuse, and household substance abuse (44.4%). On average, parents attended 75% of group sessions and were highly engaged. ACEs and PCEs were negatively correlated (r = -.44, p &lt; .001) though neither was associated with program attendance, engagement, or satisfaction. Parents reported improvements in parenting and child behavior. Conclusions: Results demonstrate that a universal, trauma-informed parenting program in public schools in high-poverty urban communities can engage parents exposed to high levels of ACEs and may disrupt intergenerational transmission of ACEs.",2024-01-31T18:48:13.890104+00:00,"parenting,school-based prevention,positive childhood experiences,adverse childhood experiences,trauma-informed",,,"Corinne Plesko, Wenyi Chen, Kelly M.

E01BB-2E8-3FB,Navigating the Maze: Living with Narcissistic Personality  Disorder,"Abstract: 
Over the last twenty years, attention and research have been paid to the term narcissism 
personality disorder. The NPD is a concept classified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders (DSM-5) as a personality disorder characterized by grandiosity, a need for 
admiration, and a lack of empathy, as stated by the American Psychiatric Association 2013. A 
person with NPD creates a great challenge for the lives of those around them because these 
individuals fundamentally believe that they are mentally healthy and that others should try harder 
to understand them. In other words, a person with an inflated self-image, a deep need for admiration, 
and who considers themselves the center of the universe believes that the rest of humanity was 
created to serve the narcissistic person. Expanding awareness of their characteristics and trying to 
equip themselves with tactics that will reduce the damage of the NPD in the lives of those around 
them.  
This article defines the narcissistic personality and its types and discusses how NPDs defend 
themselves, take revenge, and their strategies. The following describes the personality of people 
who are usually suitable prey to narcissists, the victim's view of them, and how this personality 
selects these victims. At least Providing practical solutions with examples to maintain the mental 
health of people who interact with someone with NPD in their daily lives.",2025-04-07,,,,Mina Bakhteyari Haftlangi,psyarxiv

E01FC-BBF-87F,"The role of stress-reactivity, stress-recovery and risky decision- making in psychosocial stress-induced alcohol consumption in social drinkers","Rationale Chronic alcohol misuse can escalate into alcohol use disorder (AUD). The causal mechanisms through which recreational social drinking develops into compulsive uncontrolled alcohol misuse are multifaceted. For example, stress is an important risk factor that influences alcohol craving in both healthy and addicted individuals. In addition, those that are high in impulsivity/risk taking drink more and are at greater risk of developing addiction. At present, however, it is not possible accurately to predict those at risk of escalation in alcohol use, or of developing AUD. Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate how underlying physiological and personality traits affect stress-induced craving for, and consumption of, alcohol, in a sample of healthy social drinkers. The primary hypothesis was that impulsivity/risk-taking would modulate stress-induced alcohol craving and consumption. Methods Thirty-nine participants (22 male and 17 female; mean age = 23.92 years [SD = 4.90]) were randomly allocated to “stress” and “no-stress” groups; in the stress group participants took part in the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Participants completed several questionnaires and computer tasks in order to assess prior alcohol use, impulsivity/risk-taking, stress-reactivity, craving and physiological biomarkers of stress. Finally, participants completed a voluntary drinking task, in which increasing numbers of presses on a computer keyboard were reinforced with 5ml shots of 37% ABV vodka (plus mixer). Results Participants exposed to the TSST showed an increase in craving following the stressor. Several factors predicted voluntary drinking, including risky decision making, slow HR recovery from stress, poor vagal tone during recovery from stress and greater stress reactivity. Surprisingly, we found no correlation between craving and consumption. Conclusions Our data suggest that variation in physiological stress parameters and poor decision-making abilities increase risk of stress-induced alcohol consumption. This may provide a useful translational framework through which we can further study early predictive markers for the shift between controlled recreational drinking to uncontrolled alcohol misuse, including AUD.",2018-08-11T13:05:29.840273+00:00,"impulsivity,alcohol,stress,addiction,risk-taking,substance abuse,social drinking,endophenotypes,incentive sensitization,iowa gambling task",,,"Matthew O Parker, James M Clay",psyarxiv

The two-factor reagent strip, consisting of a gold nanoparticle-based diagnostic measure and pH-based control measure, displayed a significant difference in color between simulated case and control sweat. An Arduino-based sensor and hardware apparatus were built and evaluated to integrate the strip onto a laptop mouse. A generalized linear model, gradient boosting machine, and multilayer perceptron trained on over 1.6 million data points were successfully able to detect a mood swing from a baseline emotion. The final model (with an AUC of over 85%) was implemented into the Hero mobile app to monitor a teen’s outgoing SMS messages for a mood swing. A mathematical image processing algorithm to measure vital signs was created, and repeated evaluation resulted in a percent error of &lt;5%. These results, along with external sensors/hardware devices and mobile app features, were incorporated into Hero. In contrast to previous solutions, teens can use the Hero system and mobile app for constant background monitoring of physical, emotional, and biochemical signs of overdose in their daily life.",2020-02-29T16:45:11.632016+00:00,"gold nanoparticles,stimulant abuse,addiction science,drug overdose,amphetamine detection,automated detection system,photoplethysmography,artificial intelligence",,,Divya Nori,psyarxiv
E00D2-570-002,Anger and its Consequences for Judgment and Behavior: Recent Developments in Social and Political Psychology,"In the eyes of the public—and in a substantial amount of scholarly research—anger is often framed in a negative light, given its role in driving people to act in antisocial ways. However, anger also has the potential for social good, insofar as it focuses attention on, and motivates people to fix, perceived injustices. As we discuss, the foundational link between anger and a desire to rectify justice has profoundly important implications that are relevant to research and theory in a variety of different disciplines (e.g., experimental social psychology, neuroscience, political science, personality). We begin this chapter by considering the methodological and theoretical challenges involved in the measurement of this feeling state, along with its relevance to our line of research on revenge, as well as the ideological consequences of threat. In the course of this discussion, we introduce a neo-Gibsonian framework of threat which allows for the fact that different types of threats, via anger, can exert different types of ideological consequences. A key prediction of this model—one that distinguishes it from current models of threat—is that activation of anger following threat has the potential to shift political attitudes to the “right” or to the “left”, depending on the nature of the threat at hand. These and other findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of this emotion, its relation to (perceived and actual) injustice, and its role in shaping relevant political beliefs.",2018-12-06T18:15:44.603562+00:00,"emotion,politics,anger,threat,political psychology,attitudes",,,"Alan Lambert, Fade Eadeh, Emily Hanson",psyarxiv
E00AB-4FE-59F,"The Cognitive, Ecological, and Developmental Origins of Self-disturbance in Borderline Personality Disorder","Self-disturbance is recognized as a key symptom of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). Although it is the source of significant distress and significant costs to society, it is still poorly specified. In addition, current research and models on the aetiology of BPD do not provide sufficient evidence or predictions about who is at risk of developing BPD and self-disturbance, and why. The aim of this review is to lay the foundations of a new model inspired by recent developments at the intersection of social cognition, behavioural ecology and developmental biology. We argue that the sense of agency is an important dimension to consider when characterizing self-disturbances in BPD. Second, we address the poorly characterized relation between self-disturbances and adverse life conditions encountered early in life. We highlight the potential relevance of Life-History Theory – a major framework in evolutionary developmental biology – to make sense of this association. We put forward the idea that the effect of early life adversity on BPD symptomatology depends on the way individuals trade their limited resources between competing biological functions during development.",2020-12-23T21:59:28.415259+00:00,"child abuse,agency,environmental harshness,self,social cognition,developmental plasticity,life history theory,parenting,borderline personality disorder",,,"Pierre O.

E00AA-430-D67,Cross-Societal Variation in Norm Enforcement Systems: A Review,"Across human societies, people are sometimes willing to punish norm violators. Such punishment can take the form of revenge from victims, seemingly altruistic intervention from third parties, or legitimized sanctioning from institutional representatives. Although prior work has documented cross-cultural regularities in norm enforcement, substantial variation exists in the prevalence and forms of punishment across societies. Such cross-societal variation may arise from universal psychological mechanisms responding to different socio-ecological conditions, or from cultural evolutionary processes, resulting in different norm enforcement systems. To date, empirical evidence from comparative studies across diverse societies has remained disconnected, due to a lack of interdisciplinary integration and a prevalent tendency of empirical studies to focus on different underpinnings of variation in norm enforcement. To provide a more complete view of the shared and unique aspects of punishment across societies, we review prior research in anthropology, economics, and psychology, and take a first step towards integrating the plethora of socio-ecological and cultural factors proposed to explain cross-societal variation in norm enforcement. We conclude by discussing how future cross-societal research can use diverse methodologies to illuminate key questions on the domain-specificity of punishment, the diversity of tactics supporting social norms, and their role in processes of norm change.",2023-07-28T12:35:38.712715+00:00,"punishment,culture,social norms,cross-cultural research",,,"Catherine Molho, Slewe, S.

E0030-089-277,Predicting author profiles from online abuse directed at public figures,"The problem of online threats and abuse directed at public figures could potentially be mitigated with a computational approach, where sources of abusive language are better understood or identified through author profiling. However, abusive language constitutes a specific domain of language that is untested on whether differences emerge based on personality, age, or gender of text authors. The current study presents a unique dataset of 789 abusive messages directed at politicians. It examines statistical relationships between author demographics of text authors and (abusive) language, then uses a machine learning approach to predict personality, age, and gender based on language in the texts. Results showed that 1) personality traits could be determined within 10% of their actual value, 2) age was determined with an error margin of 10 years, and 3) gender was classified correctly in 70% of the cases. Even though we found statistically significant relationships between language use and demographics, prediction performance was poor when compared to previous research on author profiling. Therefore, we suggest that further research is needed before author profiling systems can be of significant value within the context of abusive language and threat assessment.",2022-01-28T12:26:21.428017+00:00,"threat assessment,abusive language,machine learning,author profiling,threats to public figures",,,"Isabelle van der Vegt, Bennett Kleinberg, Paul Gill",psyarxiv
E00D3-09F-16E,Ayahuasca in the treatment of the consequences of chronic childhood sexual abuse in a religious community,"This retrospective case study features a woman in her mid-50s who spent her childhood in a religious community plagued by sexual abuse of children. She was abused by her father for more than a decade. The church and her mother ignored her reports about it. In her early twenties, she enrolled herself in the Erhard Seminars Training program that destabilized her, inducing a first-onset psychosis, decades later used as the main rationale for diagnosing her with bipolar disorder. For the following decades, she suffered from severe depression and emotional isolation but was functional professionally and became a medical doctor. 35 years of talk therapy helped somewhat but did not resolve trauma ingrained in her body nor her at-times catatonic depression.

In her early 50s, she experimented with psilocybin, which resulted in somatic improvement but did not resolve her depression. She wanted to attend underground ayahuasca ceremonies but was rejected because of her bipolar diagnosis. Eventually, she decided not to disclose her diagnosis and attended four ceremonies in two different ceremony groups, with excellent outcomes. She considered that the core of her embodied trauma had dissolved.

The rationale for assigning diagnoses is questioned; a focus on etiology combined with the broad-spectrum nature of psychedelic therapy may mostly eliminate the need to discern between 'psychiatric conditions'. Trauma is considered socially contagious, similar to infectious diseases. The prohibition of psychedelic therapies is interpreted as a society-wide refusal to recognize trauma: a refusal to see what actually happened and happens.",2025-03-27,"C-PTSD,ayahuasca,bipolar disorder,childhood sexual abuse,incest,medical malpractice,psilocybin,psychedelic therapy,psychedelics,psychosis,psychotherapy,sexual assault",,,Mika Turkia,psyarxiv

E018D-9B3-E27,Atypical contributions of reward decisions to momentary mood in individuals with methamphetamine use disorder,"ABSTRACT	
Backgrounds: Methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) has garnered widespread attention due to its rapidly increasing prevalence and social harm. Individuals with MUD are often accompanied by severe mood dysregulation, leading to more frequent irrational decisions such as drug-seeking behavior without consideration for consequences. Existing research indicates that the impairment of the reward system is central to the development of addiction. However, it remains unclear how the abnormal reward processing affects the mood regulation abilities of individuals with MUD. In this study, we explored the cognitive and computational mechanisms through which the subjective mood of individuals with MUD is influenced by reward information during decision-making. 
Methods: We recruited 76 male participants (27 with MUD, 49 healthy controls, HC) who completed a risk gambling task. In this task, participants were asked to choose between two options with certain or uncertain rewards. After every 2-3 gambling trials, participants also rated their momentary subjective happiness. We constructed multiple computational models to predict how various reward information (such as reward prediction error) influenced the short-term fluctuations in participants' subjective mood during risk decisions.
Results: Individuals with MUD exhibited significantly more irrational decisions compared to the HC group. Computational modeling revealed that, compared to healthy controls, individuals with MUD showed a significantly weaker influence of various reward information (e.g., expected value, EV; reward prediction error, RPE) on their subjective mood. Importantly, the EV-and RPE-mood association predict the degree of substance abuse.
Conclusions: Our findings provide computational evidence that individuals with MUD lack effective regulation of mood by the reward system. This process leads to more substance abuse. These results shed new light into the mood issues in individuals with MUD from the perspective of reward processing, thereby helping to reduce drug.",2025-06-29,,,,"Zeming Fang, Zi-Jian Cheng, Tomoko Kishimoto, Yu-Yan Gao, Ru-Yuan Zhang, Lei Guo, Wei Li, Yu-Feng Xia, Haifeng Jiang",psyarxiv
E019F-35E-C13,Ecological momentary assessment of daily stress and blood alcohol concentration in healthy drinkers: A feasibility study,"Rationale: Hazardous drinking presents a global health risk and if chronic, can escalate into an alcohol use disorder. The causal mechanisms for the transition from controlled alcohol use to uncontrolled misuse and dependence are complex, and it is not presently possible to accurately predict those most at-risk of misusing alcohol, or of developing AUD. Objectives: We investigated the feasibility of using ecological momentary assessments, specifically related to daily stress and alcohol use, to study risk factors for hazardous drinking. We tested the hypothesis that in a sample of healthy drinkers, risk-taking would modulate the impact of daily self-reported stress on alcohol use. Methods: We characterised impulsivity/risk-taking in 23 participants (12 female; mean age = 24.59 [SD = 5.34]) using a battery of questionnaires and computer tasks. We then collected daily behavioural and physiological data related to self-reported stress levels and blood alcohol concentration consumption for 30 days. Results: Attrition and missing data rates were low, with an overall response rate of 92.6% We found support for our hypothesis, with higher risk-taking and impulsive participants drinking more following daily stressors. However, the picture was not clear, with participants drinking greater volumes of alcohol at weekends, and the interactions of stress x personality trait often differing on weekdays. Conclusions: This feasibility study demonstrated the potential for was the first to demonstrate that using ecological momentary assessments, such as, digital biomarkers to assess risk factors for alcohol misuse is a viable option for investigating the effects of neurocognitive endophenotypes and stress on alcohol misuse on a longitudinal basis.",2018-09-21T14:33:01.429289+00:00,"stress,hazardous drinking,iowa gambling task,alcohol misuse,addiction,risk-taking,alcohol,endophenotypes,impulsivity,social drinking,substance abuse",,,"Matthew O Parker, James M Clay",psyarxiv

Objective: The present study explored the lived experience of midlife adoptees, using the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI; George et al. 1985-1996) to generate data that can be analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Participants and setting: AAIs were conducted with 17 adopted adults with a variety of pre and post-adoption experiences. Method: Participant narratives were analysed using Reflexive Thematic Analysis, guided by the process laid out in Braun and Clarke (2021). Results: Analysis resulted in the identification of three distinct themes: (i) 'Coming out of the fog' (ii) Unresolved Grief (iii) Living in Fear. In addition, there were five subthemes. Conclusions: This study provides evidence of trauma associated with adoptive status, our themes captured unique challenges derived from adoptive status, regardless of the variation within adoption experience.

The argument is that this can be seen clearly from Dora’s free associations to her dreams. Unfortunately, these interpretations of her dreams, although present in Freud’s account of the analysis, are overshadowed in the case study by the highly speculative further interpretations of the dreams by Freud, which derive from Freud’s own associations. Freud did have oppressive and patriarchal judgements and advice to Dora, yet he did believe that Dora was subjected to ‘persecution’ by Herr K. We must credit Freud, though, for recording, and interpreting the two dreams of Dora, on the basis of her free-associations to her waking life, even though his own associations may overshadow that success and instead relate the dreams to unconfirmable unconscious processes.",2020-07-14T17:17:16.629366+00:00,"dora,freud,dream",,,"Julia Lockheart, Mark Blagrove",psyarxiv
E0168-222-612,Survival Attachment and You:  Understanding Your Experience Beyond Diagnostic Boundaries,"Survival Attachment is a neurobiological and psychological adaptation that arises when a partner’s nervous system repeatedly encounters relational instability, even in the absence of deliberate abuse. While most commonly discussed in connection with Cluster B personality disorders—particularly narcissism and borderline personality disorder—this attachment pattern also emerges in relationships marked by chronic emotional unpredictability, as seen in conditions such as ADHD, bipolar disorder, and addiction. These patterns may not include cruelty or manipulation, but the dysregulation they generate can overwhelm a partner’s capacity for secure bonding. This paper introduces a transdiagnostic framework that reframes Survival Attachment as a shared relational outcome, not a pathology exclusive to certain diagnoses. The goal is to offer both survivors and clinicians a trauma-informed lens that recognizes the full complexity of lived experience, validating patterns of adaptation that often go unnamed, and encouraging care strategies that reach beyond traditional diagnostic silos.",2025-06-01,"Attachment Theory, Relational Trauma, Personality Disorders, Neurobiology of Attachment, Emotion Dysregulation, Trauma-Informed Care, Transdiagnostic Frameworks, Survival Strategies, ADHD, Borderline Personality Disorder",,,Charles J.

Males experience great levels of stigma, and as such, research that explores public perceptions of this victim group is needed to reduce barriers to reporting and attract gender-sensitive support. Across two studies, this paper investigates public perceptions of male victims of DVA through a mixed methods approach. In study one, 202 members of the public provided judgements of vignettes depicting a scenario of DVA, which differed as a function of victim sex and whether a ‘justification’ (i.e., infidelity) for DVA was present. After controlling for participant age, sex, and own victimisation, vignettes featuring male victims and victim infidelity were viewed more harshly. In study two, comparative deductive thematic analysis was used to explore qualitative perceptions of male victims of DVA between 5 men who did and 5 men who did not identify as being a victim of DVA. Results indicated a distinct lack of knowledge and awareness surrounding male DVA victims' experiences and the support services available, in addition to doubt in the support services’ and Criminal Justice System’s (CJS) ability to effectively respond to male victims. Taken together, this paper highlights the need for gender sensitive support, in addition to improvements across educational pathways, support services, and the CJS to end the stigmas attached to male DVA victims.",2023-07-28T18:07:36.858889+00:00,"infidelity,judgements,ipv,gender differences,male victims,dva,stigmas",,,"Courtney Hammond, Dean Fido, Paige Ambrozewicz",psyarxiv
E0062-B07-029,Authoritarianism in Action,"We propose a behavioral view of authoritarianism, and argue that the everyday psychology of rules and punishment is at its core. Authoritarianism is often understood at the nation-state level, categorizing particular regimes and practices as authoritarian, or at the individual level, as a set of tendencies or worldviews. We reposition behavior as the main unit of analysis. We specify a set of behaviors made available only when people interact with the state, and use state rules and state punishment to carry out their own desires (e.g., for revenge, dominance) at the expense of the rule of law. Then, we propose that at the heart of these authoritarian behaviors is regular, everyday psychology—the psychology of norms and norm enforcement via third party punishment, albeit formalized, codified, and refracted through state procedures. States solve large scale coordination problems, largely with codified rules and official third- party punishments. Sometimes people use these procedures to fairly and legitimately uphold the rule of law, and sometimes people use them for their own ends, amounting to authoritarianism. We review how the state channels human desires for punishment and rules, and how people can use state punishment and state rules to behave in authoritarian ways; State punishments can be administered selectively and personally. Official rules can be made that keep individuals from public services, or exist only to keep some people in positions of power over others. The psychology of norms and third party punishment, which enables large-scale human cooperation, is at the heart of authoritarianism.",2025-09-24,,,,"Connie Pui Yee Chiu, Nicolette Dakin, Jordan Wylie, Ana P.

Few studies have assessed the relationship between child maltreatment and substance use among Latinx youth. The current study used structural equation modeling to determine whether child maltreatment predicted substance use in a longitudinal sample of 504 Latinx youth. We tested the potential mediating effect of three dimensions of self-regulation (emotional, behavioral, and cognitive) on this relationship and examined whether effects varied depending on maltreatment type and severity. Our results indicated that higher levels of child maltreatment predicted higher levels of later substance use, as mediated by emotional and behavioral dysregulation (but not cognitive regulation). When separating maltreatment by subtype, we found the mediating effect was present for abuse, but not neglect.

In Experiment~1, AI was seen as less effective when it used harm-based arguments to refute misinformation; however, this gap disappeared a year later in Experiment~2, perhaps as attitudes towards AI shifted.

Few research focuses on refugees abroad. To fill this information vacuum, this study investigates Middle Eastern refugees' problems. Conflict and instability in the region have led to enormous numbers of refugees seeking protection in adjacent nations. Due to social isolation, lack of basic amenities, and sexual and gender-based psychological abuse, these refugees typically struggle to find relief. Trauma, separation, and loss affect many refugees' mental health. Refugees in the Middle East face different challenges than those in the West, but trauma-informed care should be used by care providers to improve mental health outcomes and give refugees hope and security. This study aims to define a trauma-informed treatment system for Middle Eastern clinicians to help displaced people restore self-esteem and empowerment. Our goal is to help refugees cope with the psychological and mental strains of relocation and forced migration, not physical injuries.",2025-05-01,trauma; refugees,,,"Ahmed Moustafa, Eid Abo Hamza, Salman Elbedour, Alean Al-Krenawi, Adalla Hamid",psyarxiv
E00BA-DA4-4ED,The Impact of Adding A Self-Compassion Module To The Treatment of Opioid-Dependent Young Adults: A Pilot Study,"Young adult opioid addiction is on the rise in many parts of the country. Young adults’ use of opioids, in the form of illicit prescription drugs or heroin, is especially challenging for treatment engagement and retention due to high rates of relapse and debilitating shame and guilt. Normal developmental milestones of life are halted. Mental health research has found self-compassion training to be helpful; however, it is underrepresented in addiction research. Enhancing substance abuse best treatment practices such as motivational interviewing (MI) may result in fewer incidences of relapse, as well as a decrease in shame, depression, and anxiety when paired with a focus on self-compassion. The objective of this pilot study was to determine the feasibility and potential utility of large scale study examining whether adding a self-compassion module to treatment-as-usual (TAU) increases the frequency of client change talk compared with TAU alone. A secondary focus included a review of client satisfaction scores between the two study groups to determine how they would evaluate the treatment they received and their experiences participating in the study. There were 17 opioid-dependent young adults (ages 18–25) randomly assigned to one of two conditions in an outpatient substance abuse treatment clinic. Measurements of the frequency of change talk were collected at five distinct points during the intervention. At the completion of the final session, the participants evaluated their satisfaction scores using the CSQ-8 and responded to a series of open-ended questions. Results of an ANCOVA and independent t-tests were utilized to determine any differences between the two groups in the frequency of change talk and client satisfaction. An analysis of common themes shared by participants showed a preference for individual counseling and a structured place to go, as well as a desire for the intervention to be longer than three sessions. The study indicated that a focus on self-compassion combined with treatment-as-usual did not differ in outcome when compared with treatment-as-usual alone. Additionally, both treatment conditions were equal in terms of client satisfaction. However, it should be noted that pilot trials are highly susceptible to Type II error. Issues encountered in this pilot study that have implications for large scale efficacy studies on this topic and/or with young adult opioid users were discussed.",2018-09-08T02:08:33.588551+00:00,"opioid-dependent young adults,adolescence,compassion-focused therapy",,,"Cass Dykeman, Kathyleen M.

E0065-831-A6C,Behavioral and Psychological Impacts of Childhood Sexual Abuse: A Psychosocial Analysis Among Young Adults,"Background: Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is a pervasive public health issue with enduring psychosocial consequences. Contemporary, population‑based estimates among young adults and their associations with stress and tobacco behaviors remain undercharacterized.
Methods: This study employed a cross-sectional analysis of the 2023 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data among U.S. adults aged 18–34 (N = 6,252). CSA was measured via the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) module and dichotomized (ever vs. never). Primary correlates included self‑reported stress (low/medium/high), cigarette smoking (never, someday, everyday, former), e‑cigarette use (yes/no), and sociodemographics (sex, sexual orientation, transgender identity, race/ethnicity, education, income). Survey‑weighted descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression (survey procedures) estimated adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% CIs.
Results: In the general population, the unweighted prevalence of CSA was 6.4% (n = 400), while the weighted prevalence was approximately 5.8%. In adjusted model, high stress was associated with a greater odds of reporting CSA (aOR = 1.93; 95% CI: 1.07–3.48) compared to low stress. Tobacco-related behaviors were also associated with CSA, including daily smoking (aOR = 3.16), former smoking (aOR= 1.99), occasional smoking (aOR =1.82), and e-cigarette use (aOR =1.95). Higher socioeconomic status was found to have a protective effect on CSA. Being a college graduate (aOR = 0.44) and having an annual household income of more than $100,000 (aOR = 0.48) were associated with reduced odds of CSA. Race/ethnicity was not statistically significant after adjustment. 
Conclusions: CSA remains common among US young adults and is associated with higher stress, tobacco use, and socioeconomic disadvantage; sexual minority men show elevated odds. Findings underscore the need for trauma‑informed, equity‑centered prevention and integrated behavioral health and tobacco control strategies tailored to young adults and sexual/gender minority populations.

E0134-CB1-CF9,On the use and abuse of wording factors: A systematic review and estimation of derived indices using the RSES,"Several studies have proposed the bifactor structure as the optimal model to represent wording effects observed with balanced scales. This specification allows to separate variance accounted for by the attribute from the variance attributable to the measurement method, which is used to examine the substantive or artifactual interpretation of the wording effect. However, the suitability of these method factors for this use is uncertain due to the risks of overfitting and lack of stability and interpretability of the estimated parameters, aspects barely examined in previous research. In this paper, using different indices of model assessment, we examine the degree to which the attribute and wording factors are psychometrically well-defined to serve in the SEM context as predictors or criteria, illustrating their use with the RSES scale. We carried out a systematic review in four databases (Web of Science, Scopus, PsycArticles, and Google Scholar), which resulted in 71 records that reported the factor loadings of the bifactor model or made their data available. Our findings suggest a greater prominence of the general factor in all the indicators associated with the explained and reliable common variance, stability, and construct's replicability. In contrast, the specific factors related to item wording exhibited low values in the indices of replicability and consistency. These findings support the argument that the RSES is essentially a one-dimensional instrument. Most generally, the results question the argument that wording factors can be considered appropriate criteria for examining the underlying nature of wording effects.",2023-05-18T09:02:22.251189+00:00,,,,"Victor Benito Arias, Fernando P.

E000B-F39-93D,Preprint: Altering the Cognitive-Affective Dysfunctions of Psychopathic and Externalizing Offender Subtypes with Cognitive Remediation,"Cognitive remediation is a treatment approach with the potential to translate basic science into more specific, mechanism-based interventions by targeting particular cognitive skills. The present study translated understanding of two well-defined cognitive-emotion dysfunctions into novel deficit-matched interventions and evaluated whether cognitive remediation would demonstrate specific and generalizable change. Two antisocial-subtypes, individuals with psychopathy and externalizing traits, are characterized by cognitive-affective problems that predispose them to engage in significant substance abuse and criminal behavior, culminating in incarceration. Whereas individuals with psychopathy fail to consider important contextual information, individuals with externalizing traits lack the capacity to regulate affective reactions. Training designed to remedy these subtype-specific deficits led to improvement on both trained and non-trained tasks. Such findings offer promise for changing neural and behavioral patterns, even for what many consider to be the most recalcitrant treatment population, and presage a new era of translating cognitive-affective science into increasingly specific and effective interventions.",2018-12-13T16:25:16.193354+00:00,,,,"John J.

E0091-22E-C33,Negative and positive emotional complexity in the autobiographical representations of sexual trauma survivors with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD),"This study examined the diversity of experienced positive and negative emotions – emodiversity – within two existing datasets involving female survivors of sexual abuse and assault, with chronic Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Study 1 investigated the structure of the self-concept and Study 2 explored the organization of past autobiographical knowledge. In each study, we measured emodiversity for positive and negative emotion constructs in the PTSD samples, relative to healthy control participants with no PTSD and no history of sexual trauma. Results confirmed our hypotheses that individuals with chronic PTSD would show elevated negative emodiversity and reduced positive diversity across both the structure of the self-concept and the structure of the life narrative, relative to control participants. The current results differ from community studies where greater negative emodiversity is associated with better mental health but mirror those from a prior study with individuals with Major Depressive Disorder. This suggests that valence-based differences in emodiversity are potentially a broader transdiagnostic marker of chronic emotional disorder.",2019-01-30T10:33:13.610805+00:00,,,,"Georgina Clifford, Caitlin Hitchcock, Tim Dalgleish",psyarxiv

A nationally representative study,"Objective: Many people who think about suicide do not engage in suicidal behavior. Identifying risk factors implicated in the process of behavioral enaction is crucial for suicide prevention, particularly in high-risk groups such as incarcerated offenders. Method: Cross-sectional data were drawn from a nationally representative sample of 17,891 prisoners (79% men) in the United States. We compared prisoners who attempted suicide (n = 2496) with those who thought about suicide but never made an attempt (n = 1716) on a range of established risk factors. Results: More than half (59%) of participants who experienced suicidal ideation had also attempted suicide. Violent offending, trauma, brain injury, alcohol abuse, and certain mental disorders independently distinguished attempters from ideators. Conclusion: Our results fit within recent ideation-to-action theories that emphasize the role of a capability for suicide in the transition from thoughts to acts of suicide.",2020-04-07T14:19:25.113099+00:00,"self-harm,ideation-to-action,suicidal thoughts,prison,suicide",,,Louis Favril,psyarxiv
E00B2-F6B-CCB,Lower emotional awareness is associated with greater early adversity and faster life history strategy,"Recent theoretical work suggests that emotional awareness (EA) depends on the harshness/predictability of early social interactions – and that low EA may actually be adaptive in harsh environments that lack predictable interpersonal interactions. In evolutionary psychology, this process of psychological “calibration” to early environments corresponds to life history strategy (LHS). In this paper, we tested the relationship between EA and LHS in 177 (40 male) individuals who completed the levels of emotional awareness scale (LEAS), Arizona Life History Battery (short form: K-SF-42), and two measures of early abuse/neglect. Significantly lower EA was observed in those with faster LHS and who had experienced greater early adversity. Notably, LEAS was associated with differences in 1) general reflective cognition, and 2) emotional support from parents during childhood. This suggests that EA may be learned during development based on the benefits of cognitive reflection in environments with different levels of harshness and social predictability.",2021-03-22T19:19:40.133768+00:00,"emotional awareness,early childhood adversity,life history strategy,development",,,"Horst Dieter Steklis, Netzin Steklis, John JB Allen, Richard D.

E0248-2FA-96F,Understanding Pathways of Intergenerational Transmission of Familial Violence in India through Complex Trauma Theory,"Violence against women and children is an acute problem worldwide, with 35.6% of women, and 30% to 50% of children experiencing physical, emotional, or sexual abuse. This violence not only negatively impacts the mental wellbeing of survivors, but is likely to contribute to further violence in the future, as chronic exposure to family violence has been strongly linked to both perpetration and revictimization tendencies in survivors’ adult relationships. Our study investigated intergenerational transmission of violence in Indian survivors of family violence through the lens of complex trauma. Our findings provide support for cultural validation of complex trauma theory, as the majority of participants experienced affective dysregulation, negative alterations in self-perception, and impairments in social relations. However, intergenerational transmission of violence did not occur in our sample. This may be due to the protective role played by internal contingencies of self-worth, and trauma-specific reflective functioning, which are novel findings from our study in relation to the study of complex trauma and intergenerational transmission of violence.",2022-05-27T12:16:33.740282+00:00,"social impairment,reflective functioning,complex trauma,affect dysregulation,intergenerational transmission,family violence",,,"Akanksha Mete, Simantini Ghosh",psyarxiv
E000A-8D6-8CE,"Configuration, not Content: A Network Perspective on Gendered Prototypes of Intimate Partner Violence","Research on perceptions of intimate partner violence (IPV) has primarily focused on heterosexual relationships with male perpetrators and female victims. The oversight of same-sex couples, and relationships with female abusers and male victims, has led to inconsistent findings in the literature. This incoherence might be explained by a lack of theoretical understanding of people’s beliefs and assumptions about IPV. Thus, this study aims to assess the structure of IPV prototypes of different binary victim-perpetrator gender combinations. Using a mixed-methods approach, a US- and UK-based sample (N = 161) gave open-ended responses on what they believe are common assumptions and beliefs about IPV scenarios. A psychometric network modeling approach was used to provide representations of the prototypes of the different IPV scenarios. Specifically, Gaussian graphical models of the responses were constructed, characterizing the correlations between the contents of participants’ responses. The findings show surprisingly strong global similarities between the prototypes, yet strikingly clear local differences in the domains of perpetrator, victim, relationship, and abuse.",2024-09-30T17:12:37.782217+00:00,,,,"Hanna Feige, Timothy J.

Search-based advertisements were displayed 1,481,025 times and clicked on 62,884 times (click rate: 4.25%). Since the mental health status of those in the five areas of life issues, except for addiction, was considered serious, outreach using search-based advertising could expedite effective support information to those with serious mental health conditions. In the addiction area, outreach to those with gambling and alcohol addiction was considered effective, but effective outreach to those with drug addiction was found to be difficult within the framework of this study. In conclusion, this study shows that upstream approaches for suicide prevention using search-based advertising can reach Internet users with specific life issues and deteriorating mental health.",2024-01-27T08:37:16.746855+00:00,"outreach,suicide prevention,search-based advertising,life issues,upstream approach",,,"Tai Nakahara, Asumi Takahashi, Maiko Saito, Hajime Sueki, Jiro Ito, Akiko Koda, Satoshi Ono, Akito Sakai",psyarxiv

The following trends are discussed. First, there is a large number of teens and adults convinced they exhibit symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD); they want medications (psychostimulants) to cure the symptoms. Second, many of the gatekeepers of medication management (physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants) are bombarded with requests for extensive cocktails of psychotropics, and particularly for the psychostimulants. Third, medical specialists delay fulfilment or renewal of psychostimulants by referring the patients for neuropsychological evaluations. High volume testing shows that symptoms reported as ADHD are, frequently, manifestations of other pervasive conditions. These conditions include Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder, Adult Children of Alcoholics/Adult Children of Family Abuse, Medical Conditions, Addictions, and Psychotropic Effects.

E0206-059-A36,"The Acute Effects of Psychoactive Drugs on Emotional Episodic Memory Encoding, Consolidation, and Retrieval","Psychoactive drugs modulate learning and emotional processes in ways that could impact their recreational and medical use. Recent work has revealed how drugs impact different stages of processing emotional episodic memories, including encoding (formation of memory traces), consolidation (stabilization of memory traces), and retrieval (accessing memory traces). Drugs administered before encoding more selectively modulate emotional (negative and/or positive) vs. neutral memories with preferential impairments (e.g., GABAA sedatives like alcohol and benzodiazepines, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol or THC, ketamine), enhancements (e.g., dopaminergic/noradrenergic stimulants), or both preferential impairments and enhancements (i.e., ±3,4-methylenedioxymethylamphetamine or MDMA) of emotional memories. GABAA sedatives administered immediately post-encoding (during consolidation) preferentially enhance emotional memories, and the specificity of this effect declines as the delay between encoding and retrieval increases. Finally, retrieving memories under the effects of THC, dextroamphetamine, and MDMA increases false memories, with some evidence for preferential distortions of emotional (especially positive) memories. We propose neural mechanisms underlying these effects, methodological considerations for future work, and how drug effects on emotional episodic memory may contribute to drug use and abuse.",2022-06-02T00:00:58.033267+00:00,"mdma,episodic memory,stimulants,retrograde facilitation,emotional memory,ketamine,consolidation,retrieval,drugs of abuse,zolpidem,alcohol,thc,sedatives,psychoactive drugs,encoding,amphetamine,benzodiazepines",,,"David A.

These tests are used for the scientific study of the language of lies in US Presidential candidates and fraudulent scientists, but also in criminal proceedings for evaluating allegations of child sexual abuse. The dominant approach in psycholegal deception research to date (used in 81% of recent studies that report on accuracy) to estimate the accuracy of a method is to find the optimal statistical separation between lies and truths in a single dataset. However, this method lacks safeguards against accuracy overestimation. Method &amp; Results: A simulation study and empirical data show that this procedure produces overoptimistic accuracy rates that, especially for small sample size studies typical of this field, yield misleading conclusions up to the point that a non-diagnostic tool can be shown to be a valid one.

However, the impact of normative range variability in caregiving on such biobehavioral processes remains poorly understood. Thus, we lack an essential foundation for understanding broader, population-representative developmental mechanisms of risk and resilience. Here, we conduct a scoping review of the extant literature centered on the question, “Is variability in normative range parenting associated with variability in brain structure and function?” After removing duplicates and screening by title, abstract, and full-text, 23 records were included in a qualitative review. The most striking outcome of this review was not only how few studies have explored associations between brain development and normative range parenting, but also how little methodological consistency exists across published studies. In light of these limitations, we propose recommendations for future research on normative range parenting and brain development. In doing so, we hope to facilitate evidence-based research that will help inform policies and practices that yield optimal developmental trajectories and mental health.",2019-11-22T15:51:53.921948+00:00,"parenting,brain development,mri,caregiving,fmri",,,"Madeline Farber, Ahmad R.

E0101-18E-283,The Dark Path to Eternal Life: Machiavellianism Predicts Approval of Mind Upload Technology,"Mind upload, making a digital copy of one’s brain, is a part of the transhumanistic dream of eternal life and the end of suffering. It is also perceived as a viable route toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). However, AI safety research has alerted to one major risk in creating AGI by mind upload: namely, that mind upload technology could appeal primarily to callous and selfish individuals who then abuse this technology for their personal gain—and, potentially, at a considerable cost to the welfare of humankind. Therefore, it is important to understand whether people’s acceptance of mind upload is associated with pathological and/or antisocial traits. To this end, the present research examined whether individual differences in Dark Triad traits predict attitudes toward mind upload in a sample of 1007 English-speaking adults. A pre-registered structural equation model revealed that Machiavellianism (but not psychopathy) was associated with favourable views about mind upload, both directly and indirectly through utilitarian moral attitudes. These results therefore substantiate the concerns voiced by AI safety researchers—namely, that mind upload technology could be adopted disproportionately by individuals with an antisocial personality.",2020-04-11T09:17:47.168711+00:00,"dark triad,sexual disgust,machiavellianism,utilitarianism,moral cognition,moral psychology of transhumanism,mind upload",,,"Ivar Rodríguez Hannikainen, Jukka Sundvall, Teemu Saikkonen, Anton Kunnari, Michael Laakasuo, Aku Visala, Marianna Drosinou, Mika Koverola, Marko Repo, Anton Berg",psyarxiv

Relevant Data from a Representative Survey of MTurk Participants and Wages,"To understand human behavior, social scientists need people and data. In the last decade, Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) emerged as a flexible, affordable, and reliable source of human participants and was widely adopted by academics. Yet despite MTurk’s utility, some have questioned whether researchers should continue using the platform on ethical grounds. The brunt of their concern is that people on MTurk are financially insecure, subject to abuse, and earn inhumane wages. We investigated these issues with two representative probability surveys of the U.S. MTurk population (N = 4,094). The surveys revealed: 1) the financial situation of people on MTurk mirrors the general population, 2) most participants do not find MTurk stressful or requesters abusive, and 3) MTurk offers flexibility and benefits that most people value above other options for work. People reported it is possible to earn more than $10.00 per hour and said they would not trade the flexibility of MTurk for less than $25.00 per hour.

Findings: Older adults (ages 66-89) had more risk factors than middle-aged (ages 45-65) and younger adults (ages 18-44). Polynomial regression revealed each additional risk factor was associated with a drop in cognitive performance (equivalent to three years of aging), with a larger association as age increased.

In addition to these common problems, with the more frequent and increasingly intense natural disaster and climatological events (Harvey 2018), there are inadequate Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) policies that fail to address these communities’ needs.

E01BA-19B-A7E,Validation of the Dutch version of the Creature of Habit Scale (COHS): a self-report measure of the tendency for habitual behavior in daily life,"Many of our everyday actions are made habitually, without conscious deliberation or weighing alternative actions. Habits are efficient, but difficult to break. People differ in their tendency to form habits, and these differences may relate to an individual’s risk of disorders of compulsivity, which are associated with habits, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder and substance abuse disorders. To assess the individual tendency for habit formation, Ersche et al. (2017) developed the Creature of habit scale (COHS) which measures tendency for habitual behavior in everyday life, broken down into the subscales of automatisms and routines. Impulsivity and compulsivity are thought to be associated with these subscales. Here, we carry out a preregistered validation of a Dutch translation of the COHS in a Dutch-speaking sample (N=411). An exploratory factor analysis replicated the original distinction between the scales automatism and routine. A further confirmatory factor analysis replicated the relationship with the traits impulsivity and compulsivity. Finally, we explored the relationship with problematic alcohol use.

E00AC-311-3A5,Defining Gaslighting in Intimate Partner Violence: Insights from Victim-Survivors and Support Service Providers,"With growing attention on criminalizing psychological forms of abuse, it is imperative that researchers develop clear and intentional definitions of abstract concepts, like gaslighting. The purpose of this paper was to develop a definition of gaslighting by comparing key points of contention in existing literature with the first-hand experiences of victim-survivors and support service providers, in order to enhance future research and practical application of the term in policy and legal contexts. The study used an online open-ended survey to gather data from victim-survivors and support service providers about their definitions of gaslighting. Responses were analysed using qualitative content analysis to identify definitional components of gaslighting. The study identified six key components of gaslighting: behavior, outcomes, intention, repetition, subsidiary tactics, and the role of power and intimacy. The study proposed a definition of gaslighting informed by victim-survivor and service provider perspectives, while acknowledging the need for further research to refine controversial components like intention, repetition, and power imbalances. Further, it addresses limitations such as the lack of perpetrator perspectives and the need for more diverse samples in the refinement of future definitions and measurements of gaslighting.",2025-01-30T01:59:24.269895+00:00,"gaslighting,intimate partner violence",,,"Celine van Golde, Helen M.

E0113-437-EBC,The Hateful Eight (H8): An Efficient Multifaceted Approach to the Short Dark Tetrad (SD4),"Using the 28 items of the Short Dark Tetrad (SD4; Paulhus et al., 2021), we developed a 16-item version with two items for each of eight facets called the Hateful Eight (H8). Across four studies of university and online samples (Ntotal=2,391), we used item response theory models and confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) to select the “best” SD4 items. CFAs supported both an eight-facet solution and hierarchical models in which the eight facets loaded onto their four respective Dark Tetrad traits, which in turn loaded onto a global Dark Tetrad factor. We labeled the eight facets as: deviousness, scheming (both assigned to Machiavellianism); leadership, exceptionalism (both assigned to narcissism); defiance, recklessness (both assigned to psychopathy); and violent voyeurism, verbal abuse (both assigned to sadism). We tested the H8’s convergent and discriminant validity with number of sexual partners, self-esteem, Big Five personality, adult attachment, and established measures of the Dark Triad traits.",2025-08-27,"Dark Personality,Dark Tetrad,Dark Triad,Facets,Item Response Thoery,Machiavellianism,Measurement,Narcissism,Personality,Personality Facets,Psychopathy,Sadism",,,"Paul Silvia, Val Wongsomboon, Rebekah Rodriguez-Boerwinkle, Christian Blötner, Gregory D.

We explored whether individuals with PTSD possess a highly affectively-compartmentalized self-structure, whereby positive and negative self-attributes are sectioned off into separate components of self-concept (e.g., self as an employee, lover, mother). We also examined redundancy (i.e., overlap) of positive and negative self-attributes across the different components of self-concept. Participants generated a set of self-aspects that reflected their own life (e.g., ‘self at work’,). They were then asked to describe their self-aspects using list of positive or negative attributes. Results revealed that, relative to the control group, the PTSD group used a greater proportion of negative attributes and had a more compartmentalized self-structure. However, there were no significant differences between the PTSD and control groups in positive or negative redundancy. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the key findings were not accounted for by comorbid diagnosis of depression. Findings indicated that the self-structure is organized differently in those with PTSD, relative to those with depression or good mental health.",2018-12-17T10:21:14.683287+00:00,"post-traumatic stress disorder,overgeneral,self-concept,compartmentalization,autobiographical memory",,,"Georgina Clifford, Tim Dalgleish, Caitlin Hitchcock",psyarxiv
E0247-CD1-CB1,Confirmatory factor analysis of the Maltreatment and Abuse Chronology of Exposure (MACE) scale: Evidence for essential unidimensionality,"The Maltreatment and Abuse Chronology of Exposure (MACE) scale is a retrospective self-report scale that measures 10 distinct types of childhood maltreatment. Despite its increasing use, the factor structure of the MACE has not been thoroughly investigated. As such, the viability of the MACE total and subscale scores are uncertain. The current study investigated the factor structure of the MACE in order to quantify the reliability of its total and subscale scores. Two independent samples of participants (N=1051 &amp; N=582) who completed the MACE were included in this study. Using confirmatory item response models, we tested one-factor and several bifactor models of participants’ responses. We used model-based indices to estimate the reliability of the MACE total and subscale scores, and to quantify the essential unidimensionality of the scale. We found the MACE total score was a reliable and valid measure of overall childhood maltreatment. In contrast, although we found MACE subscale scores exhibited adequate reliability, the vast majority of their reliable variance reflected general maltreatment and not any particular type of maltreatment as intended. We also found that the MACE is essentially unidimensional and some of its items exhibit differential item functioning by gender. Our results provide support for a one-factor structure of the MACE, as well as continued use of the MACE total score. Our results caution against the use of MACE subscale scores, which have little practical use insofar that they provide little unique, reliable information above and beyond the total score.",2022-09-20T13:20:45.676685+00:00,,,,"Lauri Tuominen, Samuel Zorowitz",psyarxiv
E005E-E0B-559,Problem drinking is associated with intimate partner cyber abuse perpetration but is buffered by high relationship satisfaction,"Purpose: Intimate partner cyber abuse (IPCA) is a prevalent form of intimate partner violence (IPV) that has detrimental effects on victims’ well-being. Although research has documented associations with other forms of IPV perpetration, additional research is needed to identify IPCA perpetration risk factors. One of the most common risk factors for offline IPV is perpetrators’ alcohol use; however, less is known about how this translates to online contexts. There is also a need to identify protective factors that mitigate the effects of alcohol. Methods: This study evaluated associations between drinking, relationship satisfaction, and IPCA perpetration via self-report questionnaires within a longitudinal framework. Participants included 544 adults in an intimate relationship (n = 296 at T2). Results: Results indicated that relationship satisfaction buffered the effects of problem drinking on IPCA perpetration at T1, but not at T2. Further, 20.2% of individuals who perpetrated IPCA at T1 drank alcohol during at least one incident, and these individuals reported more problem drinking and more frequent IPCA perpetration compared to those who reported IPCA without alcohol. Conclusions: Results from this study provide insight into both risk and protective factors for IPCA perpetration among adults and have the potential to guide concurrent prevention strategies that target intersections between problem drinking, IPCA, and offline IPV, and promote healthy and satisfying intimate relationships.",2022-05-31T17:04:28.136534+00:00,,,,"Jacqueline Woerner, Erica Fissel",psyarxiv

In addition to these common problems, with more frequent and increasingly intense natural disasters and climatological events (Harvey 2018), there are inadequate Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) policies that fail to address the needs of these communities. Most work on minority communities is heavily biased by the Western ideology of colorism, as well as a binary conception gender and sexual orientation: black or white, man or woman, straight or gay. These theories are dismissive towards the multitude of identities within these communities, especially those in non-Western settings. DRR policies and overall risk preparedness and response structures fail to acknowledge the experiences and needs of these communities. Research has been conducted to gather and evaluate experiences of marginalized communities impacted by climatological or natural disaster events. Results from this study can help inform, update, or create new and more-inclusive DRR policies that recognize the experiences and needs of minority communities, and improve outcomes for these individuals.

E011F-BDA-89C,“Consumed by Creed”: Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms Underpin Ideological Obsession and Support for Political Violence,"Radicalization is a process by which individuals are introduced to an ideological belief system that encourages political, religious, or social change through the use of violence. Here, we formulate an obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) model of radicalization that links Obsessive Passion (one of the best predictors of radical intentions) to a larger body of clinical research. The model’s central tenet is that OCD tendencies shape radical intentions via their influence on Obsessive Passion. Across four ideological samples in the United States (Environmental activists, Republicans, Democrats, and Muslims, N = 1,114), we found direct effects between OCD symptoms and radical intentions, as well as indirect effects of OCD on radical intentions via Obsessive Passion. Even after controlling for potential clinical confounds (e.g., adverse childhood experiences, anxiety, depression, substance abuse), these effects remained robust, implying that OCD plays a significant role in the formation of violent ideological intentions and opening up new avenues for the treatment and prevention of violent extremism. We discuss the implications of conceptualizing radicalization as an OCD-like disorder with compulsive violent tendencies and ideology-related concerns.",2022-09-04T14:40:06.183748+00:00,"violent extremism,radicalization,obsessive passion,mental health,political violence,environmental activists,terrorism,ace,symptoms,depression,ocd,radicalism,democrat,anxiety,obsessive-compulsive disorder,substance abuse,muslim,usa,republican",,,"Jais Adam-Troian, Jocelyn Belanger",psyarxiv
E0192-2F2-358,Economic inequality increases race salience in 6 million Tweets,"Economic inequality brings multiple adverse consequences. These range from decreased trust in government, increased drug abuse and violence, and decreased societal cohesion. If and how economic inequality impacts online behaviors has received less attention. Here, we use a corpus of 6 million race tweets posted between 2012 and 2018 to determine the frequency and sentiment of tweets containing ethnic epithets and slurs across all 52 US states. Informed by Integrated Threat Theory, we tested whether inequality increased the use of slurs on social media for the purpose of denigrating other ethnic groups. Consistent with this, we found that states with greater inequality predicted increased use of racial epithets used to denigrate other groups. However, we also found that more unequal locales were positively correlated with increased use of ethnic words used in a positive way (potentially toward other ingroup members). As such, while inequality is correlated with more prejudicial behavior on social media, it may also increase the salience of ethnic group identity more broadly. Implications and future directions are discussed.",2021-09-19T10:55:38.037775+00:00,"racism,social,prejudice,inequality,race,media,twitter",,,"H.T. McGovern, Khandis Blake, Kelly Kirkland",psyarxiv

E00A4-805-73B,Growing up Fast: The role of Early-Life Adversity and DNA Methylation in Pubertal Development and Sexual Behavior,"Background
A premise in the life-history framework is that organisms strategically allocate resources to growth, maintenance and reproduction in response to environmental conditions. In the current study, we investigated the relationship between early-life adversity, pubertal maturation, and sexual behavior with a focus on the role of epigenetic mechanisms as potential mediators of these associations.
Methods
Using data from a large, ongoing longitudinal study (N = 15,645) spanning more than the first 27 years of participants' lives, we aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of how early environmental factors and biological processes interact to influence developmental and reproductive outcomes.
Results
Consistent with the life-history framework, earlier maternal age at menarche, lower socioeconomic status, and having experienced child abuse predicted an earlier age at menarche, earlier age at first intercourse, and earlier age at first parenthood. However, epigenetic age acceleration did not mediate these associations.
Conclusions
Future research should explore alternative epigenetic markers and consider broader family dynamics to better understand the nuanced effects of early-life experiences on the onset and course of sexual development and the timing of parenthood.",2025-03-27,,,,"Geertjan Overbeek, Jana Runze, Susanne Schulz",psyarxiv
E0081-5F4-AFD,Childhood Predictors of Belief in Life After Death across 22 Countries,"Belief in life after death is one of the oldest and most widespread spiritual convictions, and it has been shown to offer various psychological benefits. Understanding the predictors of afterlife beliefs is crucial for gaining insight into religious tenets and their broader impacts on individuals and societies. This retrospective longitudinal study used the first wave of nationally representative data from the Global Flourishing Study, covering 22 countries (N = 202,898), to examine 13 potential childhood predictors of afterlife belief in adulthood. We applied modified Poisson regression to analyze how these predictors influenced afterlife belief. Random-effects meta-analyses aggregated results for the 11 common predictors across all countries. Our results indicated that religious service attendance at age 12 was the most consistent predictor of afterlife belief in adulthood. Negative early experiences—such as childhood abuse and feelings of being an outsider—along with a strong maternal relationship, were linked to higher levels of afterlife belief. Additionally, female gender were associated with an increased likelihood of afterlife belief. This study is the first to use multinational data to provide evidence that a combination of childhood factors are related to afterlife beliefs in adulthood.",2025-03-14,,,,"Alexander Moreira de Almeida, Zhuo Job Chen, Byron R.

This study used mixed methods (i.e., moderation analysis, content analysis) to explore the effects of social support and childhood ostracism on paraphilic thoughts, and further explored individuals' views on people with sexually deviant attitudes and behaviours. Two hundred seventeen participants (mean age = 27.5 years, 63.6% female) responded to an online survey. In men, but not in women, the relationship between childhood experiences of ostracism and paraphilic thoughts was strengthened in individuals with high social support, and weaker in individuals with low social support. The qualitative analysis indicated differences in attitudes of the general population between people who have committed sexual offences and people who have sexually deviant thoughts. Results of this study raise internationally applicable questions about the development of public health support for people with deviant sexual thoughts and attitudes via interventions to help prevent potential sex offences in adulthood, thus, challenging and potentially preventing the cyclical relationship of sexual abuse reviewed in the literature.",2024-04-17T15:44:09.132634+00:00,"public views,public health,paraphilic,social support,childhood ostracism",,,"Katia Vione, Dean Fido, Daniel Lodge",psyarxiv
E020D-F14-265,The march of folly: psychological conditions in certain politicians,"An attempt is made in this review to analyze psychological conditions of selected politicians. Physical maltreatment was described in biographies of Vladimir Putin. Child abuse is associated with various psychiatric and related conditions including paranoia. A paranoid call may sanction destruction of supposed enemies. Putin formulated the aims of his military operation, one of them being protection of Russian-speakers from genocide. It is known that ethnic Russians have not undergone genocide. Apparently, this idea is delusional. Certain war instigators are paranoid in their tendency to present themselves as prophets or world saviors. Some of them are aggressive against delusional goals. Mentally healthy people can be susceptible to psychotic appeals, a predisposing condition being fear of strangers and projection of hatred upon them. Some ethnically non-Russian subjects within and outside the Federation may be interested in a continuation of the Ukraine war; and there are concerns that Putin has come under their influence. The most important topic in this connection is the inter-ethnic difference in the birth rate and migrations, which is avoided by Russian media and officials these days. Potential mental conditions of some other politicians and ideologists are briefly analyzed here.",2025-05-11,,,,Sergei V. Jargin,psyarxiv

The ACE study is a large epidemiological study that examines the health impact of adverse childhood events on the health of adults in an HMO population. In the current study, they used data from 658 participants who completed the ACE study on two separate occasions, approximately a year apart. They found some mild differences in the two reports, but overall retrospective reports of adverse childhood events were stable over time. For child maltreatment researchers, the reliability of retrospective findings is no mere methodological quibble. Much of what we know about the long-term effects of childhood abuse comes from retrospective studies. But what about the prospective findings? Depending on the research question, prospective studies can provide a number of significant advantages over retrospective designs. Researchers often consider prospective designs to be more rigorous, with less biased sample selection and better measurement of the natural history of a phenomenon. Given the strengths of prospective data, does this mean that we should now disregard findings from retrospective studies?

Relatively little research, however, has explored dependency’s links to sexual activity and sexual functioning, the findings of which stand to offer a similar wealth of knowledge valuable to sex counseling, couples therapy, sexual health, and our overall understanding of sexuality. The current study utilized a multimethod research design to explore dependency as it relates to sexual and romantic relationships and sexual activity. Multiple associations emerged between dependency, both interpersonal dependency and a healthy variant of dependency, and sexual activity.

E00EF-046-17E,A Description–Experience Framework of the Dynamic Response to Risk,"The modern world holds countless risks for humanity, both large-scale and intimately personal—from cyber warfare, pandemics, and climate change to sexually transmitted diseases and drug use and abuse. Many risks have prompted institutional, regulatory, and technological countermeasures, the success of which depends to some extent on how individuals learn about the risks. We distinguish between two powerful but imperfect teachers of risk. First, people may learn by consulting symbolic and descriptive material, such as warnings, statistics, and images. Yet more often than not, a risk’s fluidity defies precise description. Second, people may learn about risks through personal experience. Responses to risk can differ systematically depending on whether people learn through one mode, both, or neither. One important reason for these differences is the discrepancy in the cognitive impact that rare events (typically the risk event) and common events (typically the non-occurrence of the risk event) have on the decision maker. We propose a description–experience framework that highlights the dynamic relationship of description and experience and the importance of the statistical structure of risk events and that offers a new perspective on humans’ sometimes puzzling responses to risks.",2020-08-07T15:38:52.421503+00:00,"risk communication,information sampling,risk behavior,risk perception,probability weighting,description-experience gap,dynamic decision making",,,"Ralph Hertwig, Dirk U.

E008E-C1B-52E,Impaired learning from errors and punishments and maladaptive avoidance – general mechanisms underlying self-regulation disorders?,"Self-regulation (SR) relates to quality of life in multiple domains. Previous studies have found important correlates of low SR including impulsivity and poor emotional regulation; however, underpinnings of low SR are incompletely understood. Individuals low in SR frequently engage in maladaptive behaviors (substance abuse, procrastination, etc.) despite negative consequences. This suggests that impaired learning from errors and punishments may be important mechanisms underlying low SR. Consistently, previous studies observed impaired error processing and learning from errors and punishments in SR-related disorders. We speculate on transdiagnostic factors underlying poor SR. Impaired error processing (possibly related to striatal functioning) may prevent subjects with low SR from learning from errors and punishments and thus learning better SR . Additionally, impaired coping in emotionally challenging situations, possibly related to prefrontal-cortical functioning, may lead to maladaptive avoidance. Moreover, maladaptive behaviors may be reinforced by temporary decreases in negative affect and rewarding values of behaviors. Given existing knowledge gaps, we call for more extensive research and describe possible directions and challenges for future studies.",2020-08-27T09:15:14.993308+00:00,"punishment,substance related disorders,addictions,avoidance learning,procrastination,emotional regulation,self-control,self-regulation,impulsive behavior",,,"Marc N.

This study investigated the relationship between metacognition and trait mindfulness in healthy older adults, specifically examining metacognitive efficiency in memory and emotion recognition. Methods: Mindfulness was measured using the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire - Short Form (FFMQ-SF) while metacognitive efficiency across memory and emotion was captured using participants’ level of metacognitive sensitivity given a certain level of task performance. Results: Partial correlation analyses revealed distinct significant associations. The observing facet of the FFMQ-SF was linked to memory-related metacognitive efficiency (r = .28, p &lt;.006), while the describing facet correlated with emotion-related metacognitive efficiency (r = .29, p =.004). In contrast, no significant correlations were found between the total mindfulness score and both memory and emotion-related metacognitive efficiency. Conclusions: These findings underscore the psychometric characteristics inherent in the FFMQ-SF and their potential significance for shaping mindfulness-focused interventions.

E00C6-DC4-1DD,The Value of Dimensional Models of Early Experience: Thinking Clearly about Concepts and Categories,"We review the three prevailing approaches—specificity, cumulative risk, and dimensional models— to conceptualizing the developmental consequences of early-life adversity and address fundamental problems with the characterization of these frameworks in a recent Perspectives on Psychological Science piece by Smith and Pollak (2020). We respond to concerns raised by Smith and Pollak about dimensional models of early experience and highlight the value of these models for studying the developmental consequences of early-life adversity. Basic dimensions of adversity proposed in existing models include threat/harshness, deprivation, and unpredictability. These models identify core dimensions of early experience that cut across the categorical exposures that have been the focus of specificity and cumulative risk approaches (e.g., abuse, institutional rearing, and chronic poverty); delineate aspects of early experience that are likely to influence brain and behavioral development; afford hypotheses about adaptive and maladaptive responses to different dimensions of adversity; and articulate specific mechanisms through which these dimensions exert their influences, conceptualizing experience-driven plasticity within an evolutionary-developmental framework. In doing so, dimensional models advance specific falsifiable hypotheses, grounded in neurodevelopmental and evolutionary principles, that are supported by accumulating evidence and provide fertile ground for empirical studies on early-life adversity.",2020-10-12,"childhood adversity,deprivation,early-life stress,experience-driven plasticity,harshness,threat,unpredictability",,,"Margaret Sheridan, Jay Belsky, Kathryn Humphreys, Bruce J Ellis, Katie A.

Based on expert interviews, a literature review, feedback form the community and discussions within the commission, the following problematic issues were identified: (P1) negligent or fraudulent scientific practices, (P2) abuse of power, (P3) insufficient mentoring of Early Career Researchers, (P4) insufficient quality of teaching, (P5) counterproductive incentives, (P6) overburdening of professors with tasks, (P7) fixed- and short-term contracts for most employees, (P8) unnecessarily steep power differentials, (P9) an ineffective peer-review system, (P10) lack of validity in personnel selection procedures, (P11) low awareness and commitment regarding ethical norms, and (P12) weak mechanisms for detecting and sanctioning unethical behavior. The commission offers concrete recommendations for changes to the academic system that should make the occurrence of unethical behavior less likely. Even though some of these recommendations might be rather specific for the field of psychology and for the German academic system, most of them may be valid for science in general.",2025-06-24,,,,"Annette Kluge, Franz Richter, Le Vy Phan, Ncole Bössel, Dorothee Mischkowski, Jutta Stahl, Manfred Schmitt, Daniel Leising",psyarxiv

E01F7-CF2-8CF,Breaking the silence on sexual harassment: understanding victims’ perceptions in Japan,"Despite recent legal reforms, the concept of sexual harassment remains unclear in Japan. The current legal framework only covers incidents in workplaces, leaving victims outside the work environment without adequate protection. Despite the rising public awareness, a significant gap persists in understanding how victims process and respond to their experiences of sexual harassment. To gain a deeper understanding of victims’ experiences and how they make sense of their reactions to sexual harassment, we performed a qualitative study with 12 participants who had experienced sexual harassment at one point in their lives in Japan. Our findings revealed that some of the Japanese participants chose to remain non-confrontational in response to sexually abusive acts, while the non-Japanese participants preferred to take direct action. The power imbalance created by hierarchy, the participants’ adherence to the concepts of Wa (social harmony) and Gaman (endurance), and the deficiencies in the legislative system seemed to discourage them from seeking justice, which in turn allowed the perpetrators to avoid accountability. Considering these factors, there is a clear need to establish a more comprehensive and transparent legal framework that protects victims of sexual harassment and abuse in all contexts and encourages them to come forward with confidence, knowing that such acts will be addressed by law enforcement.",2025-08-01,,,,"Soyhan Egitim, Claire Chan Nok Yin",psyarxiv
E0040-A26-402,Influence of early life adversity and breed on aggression and fear in dogs,"Among the animals on this planet, dogs are uniquely adapted for life with humans, a status that exposes them to risks of human-mediated traumatic experiences. At the same time, some lineages of dogs have undergone artificial selection for behavioral phenotypes that might increase risk or resilience to stress exposure, providing an opportunity to examine interactions between heritable and acquired traits. In a large-scale study (N = 4,497), English-speaking dog guardians reported on their dogs’ life histories, current living environments, and provided observer ratings of dog behavior using the Canine Behavior Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ). Our analysis revealed that adverse experiences in the first six months of life, such as abuse and relinquishment, were significantly associated with increased aggression and fearfulness in adulthood, even when accounting for factors such as acquisition source, sex, and neuter status. Additionally, effects of adversity on fearful and aggressive behavior systematically varied at the breed level, suggesting heritable factors for risk and resilience for developing particular phenotypes. Our findings establish that breed ancestry and individual experience interact to show fear and aggressive behavior in pet dogs, confirming that socioemotional behavior is shaped by gene-environment interactions.",2025-05-15,"Aggression,Animal behaviour,Behaviour development,C-BARQ,Canine science,Canis familiaris,Dog behaviour,Domestic dog,Early life adversity,Early life stress,Epigenetics,Fear,Gene-environment interactions,Psychological stress,Psychological wellbeing,Sensitive period",,,"Erin E.

E010E-D57-74E,Linguistic trajectories of bipolar disorder on social media,"Language provides valuable markers of affective disorders such as bipolar disorder (BD), yet clinical assessments remain limited in scale. In response, analyses of social media (SM) language have gained prominence due to their high temporal resolution and longitudinal scope. Here, we introduce a method to determine the timing of users’ diagnoses and apply it to study language trajectories from 3 years before to 21 years after BD diagnosis - contrasted with uses reporting unipolar depression (UD) and non-affected users (HC). We show that BD diagnosis is accompanied by pervasive linguistic alterations reflecting mood disturbance, psychiatric comorbidity, substance abuse, hospitalization, medical comorbidities, unusual thought content, and disorganized thought. We further observe recurring mood-related language changes across two decades after the diagnosis, with a pronounced 12-month periodicity suggestive of seasonal mood episodes. Finally, trend-level evidence suggests an increased periodicity in users estimated to be female. In sum, our findings provide evidence for language alterations in the acute and chronic phase of BD. This validates and extends recent efforts leveraging SM for scalable monitoring of mental health.",2025-09-12,"bipolar disorder,depression,language,language disorganization,natural language processing,periodicity,social media",,,"Armin Zlomuzica, Laurin Plank",psyarxiv

E01F3-B8C-41A,"Acceptance of sex dolls and robots as a function of their appearance, intended use, and age","The use of social robots for various functions has risen in both popularity and attention in recent years. Principally this has focused on sex dolls and robots. In this research we investigated how the appearance, function, and perceived age of sex dolls and robots impact social attitudes toward them. Two well-powered experimental studies tested the hypotheses that more life-like, sexualized, and child-resembling dolls and robots provoke stronger negative reactions and less interest in ownership. Consistent with the uncanny valley effect, the findings indicate that increasingly realistic dolls and robots are met with more negative responses, with this effect being exacerbated when owners use their dolls and robots for sexual reasons (Study 1; N = 275). When looking at the ostensible age of a doll, child-like sex dolls elicit significantly harsher judgments, with this likely being due to societal concerns about potential risks for real child abuse (Study 2; N = 222). This research underscores the complex interplay between technology, social perceptions, and the evolving landscape of human-robot interactions, particularly in the sexual domain. Further research is suggested to disentangle the explanations of our experimental results.",2024-07-12,"sex dolls,sex robots,sexuality,social attitudes",,,"Rebecca Lievesley, Ellie Woodward, Craig A.

E00F5-1F9-AEE,COVID-19: INDIA’S RESPONSE TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE NEEDS RETHINKING,"COVID-19 is posing challenges larger challenges in terms of human rights including health rights of women and children. Since the mandatory lockdown has been imposed, violence against women is exponentially rising world over. Several countries have enacted special policies, laws and programs to deal with violence against women in homes. However, India which since the 90s has witnessed widening inequalities since the policy of Liberalization, Globalization and Privatization has been introduced, right now is again facing the disastrous impact due to coronavirus. The pandemic is making adverse gender impact in two ways – 1) Middle- or upper-class women facing abuse in homes during the lockdown and 2) Poor women who have no homes or are surviving in slums or those on the roads walking back home or those awaiting in villages for migrant men to come back. The National Commission for Women has reported a rise of 94 percent in complaint cases where women have been abused in their homes during lockdown. Also, another aspect that has not received attention is increasing number of cases where migrant women, along with men, are walking hundreds of miles, some in their advanced stage of pregnancy along with their children, without food. Some are being forced to deliver babies on the roadside while others are receiving the devastating news of migrant men being dead while walking on roads. Deprivation and denial of health and other services to women and children during the COVID crisis is aggravating the disaster. Therefore, almost half a billion women are at risk in India due to the pandemic. Yet, the state has not made any comprehensive COVID response plan to tackle these challenges. Neither any formal statement is being issued to declare domestic violence as an essential service nor plans have been made to support pregnant women workers walking hundreds of miles without food and water with their children. Rather, the state after 40 days of lockdown, while easing down the restrictions, opened the liquor shops as a first step. In doing so, earning revenue is prioritized over genuine serious concerns of women. This is despite of the fact that the women’s movement has shown evidences that consumption of liquor by men is proportional to an increase in incidences of abuse. This essay investigates the gaps in the state’s response in India to the increase in incidents of violence during the lockdown and argues that a robust comprehensive plan is required to address different aspects of violence women are facing in the largest democracy. The government cannot miss the chance to protect women from violence. In order to imagine a gender just violence-free world, the need is to impose the lockdown on the collective imagination that reiterate gender-stereotypical notions and to put the viruses of patriarchy and poverty in quarantine and isolation forever. By maintaining social distancing with the misogynist ideas and developing a plan to eliminate inequalities in all forms, gender justice and human rights could be achieved and the rights guaranteed under Article 14, 15, and 21 of the Constitution can be reclaimed.",2020-05-25T08:25:39.719177+00:00,,,,Shalu Nigam,psyarxiv
E018A-1F8-E54,Trait Mindfulness May Buffer Against the Deleterious Effects of Childhood Abuse in Recurrent Depression: A Retrospective Exploratory Study,"Objective: Individuals with a history of childhood maltreatment are particularly vulnerable to a longer course of depression. Immunization theories of resilience suggest that resilience and related factors may buffer against the deleterious effects of early childhood adversity. Trait mindfulness is linked to resilience and may be a pathway to cultivating this dynamic process. In this study, we investigated whether trait mindfulness can buffer against the effects of early childhood maltreatment in predicting lifetime number of months depressed. Method: We recruited 43 previously depressed, currently remitted patients, and retrospectively examined their depression history (using a structured interview, LIFE-SCID), their self-reported experience of maltreatment in the first 16 years of life (MOPS), and their levels of trait mindfulness (MAAS). Results: We found that number of months depressed in a lifetime was positively associated with reported childhood maltreatment, and negatively associated with trait mindfulness. Secondly, we found evidence that trait mindfulness significantly moderated the relationship of early childhood maltreatment and number of months depressed. Specifically, it appears that individuals who report severe histories of maltreatment are especially vulnerable to recurrent depression if they are also reporting low levels of trait mindfulness. Conclusions: Increasing mindfulness may be warranted among individuals reporting a history of childhood abuse with lower baselines of trait mindfulness; however, results of this retrospective study require replication in a larger, prospective trial.",2018-02-01T18:44:38.326309+00:00,,,,Shadi Beshai,psyarxiv
E0073-796-FD0,Dampening of Positive Affect Predicts Substance Use During Partial Hospitalization,"Background: Elevated positive affect is associated with craving for substances of abuse, yet little is known about regulation of positive emotion in substance use disorders. This study tested if the emotion regulation strategy of dampening (deliberately down-regulating positive affect) contributes to substance use outcomes in a transdiagnostic sample. Methods: Participants (N = 120) were adults endorsing risky substance use, recruited from an acute psychiatric treatment program that requires abstinence during treatment. Craving and dampening were assessed at admission. Results: A logistic regression to evaluate likelihood of substance use during treatment yielded a significant interaction between dampening and frequency of substance use in the previous month: odds of use during treatment were higher among those with heavier pre-treatment use, but only at high levels of dampening. Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence that dampening increases risk for substance use among those with high levels of pre-treatment substance use. Findings are limited by the use of a general psychiatric sample, which did not include individuals seeking treatment for substance use disorders; future studies are needed to replicate this effect in individuals with substance use disorders. Results point to the need for interventions to enhance healthy regulation of positive affect in substance-using populations.",2019-09-16T21:25:43.609269+00:00,,,,"Andrew D. Peckham, R.

E0232-C30-DDB,A review on aversive Pavlovian-to-Instrumental transfer in humans,"A cue that indicates imminent threat elicits a wide range of physiological, hormonal, autonomic, cognitive, and emotional fear responses in humans and facilitates threat-specific avoidance behavior. The occurrence of a threat cue can, however, also have general motivational effects and affect behavior. That is, the encounter with a threat cue can increase our tendency to engage in general avoidance behavior that does neither terminate nor prevent the threat-cue or the threat itself. Furthermore, the encounter with a threat-cue can substantially reduce our likelihood to engage in behavior that leads to rewarding outcomes. Such general motivational effects of threat-cues on behavior can be informative about the transition from normal to pathological anxiety and could also explain the development of comorbid disorders, such as depression and substance abuse. Despite the unmistakable relevance of the motivational effects of threat for our understanding of anxiety disorders, their investigation is still in its infancy. Pavlovian-to-Instrumental transfer is one paradigm that allows us to investigate such motivational effects of threat cues. Here, we review studies investigating aversive transfer in humans and discuss recent results on the neural circuits mediating Pavlovian-to-Instrumental transfer effects. Finally, we discuss potential limitations of the transfer paradigm and future directions for employing Pavlovian-to-Instrumental transfer for the investigation of motivational effects of fear and anxiety.",2020-09-15T18:55:40.954199+00:00,,,,"Merel Kindt, Anna Gerlicher",psyarxiv
E0071-9FA-593,The role of time perspectives and impulsivity dimensions in coping styles,"Both time perspectives and impulsivity dimensions are groups of traits that are connected to self-control abilities and might be important for coping styles. However, to date, no study has systematically investigated their utility in predicting coping styles with regard to their multidimensional nature. The current study was correlational and exploratory, aiming to discover what amount of variance in each of the three coping styles, problem-oriented, active emotion-oriented, and avoidant, is accounted for by two groups of predictors: time perspectives and impulsivity dimensions. N = 397 young adults aged 18–35 from the general population took part in the study. Results of a multiple linear regression testing both groups of predictors separately and of hierarchical regression analysis introducing the two predictor groups in subsequent steps suggested that time perspectives accounted for more variance in adaptive coping styles: problem-oriented and active emotion-oriented coping. For avoidant coping, both time perspectives and impulsivity dimensions accounted for a similar amount of variance. The results provide evidence that time perspectives should be investigated in domains related to coping (e.g., mental health issues, substance abuse, and risk-taking behaviors), for which impulsivity has been considered an important predictor. Moreover, impulsivity ought to be tested with regard to its multidimensionality.",2020-12-28T16:15:43.620413+00:00,"impulsivity,time perspectives,self-regulation,coping,young adults",,,Iwona Nowakowska,psyarxiv
E016A-9FD-C73,Parental Nativity and Familial Acceptance of Sexual and Gender Minority Latinx Youth,"Accepting and sharing about oneself as a sexual and gender minority (SGM) individual is complex. This is even more complex for individuals who identify as both SGM and Latino because they possess more than one minoritized identity. As a result, SGM Latino youth are more susceptible to higher levels of stress, which if not effectively managed, can lead to homelessness, anxiety and depression, and substance abuse. Latino family members find it difficult to learn how to positively interact with their SGM family member (e.g., in the early phases of coming out). In this quantitative survey study, researchers examined survey data collected from 1,877 Latino youth concerning home experiences, health, identity, and parental nativity. Data were drawn from the LGBTQ National Teen Survey, an online, anonymous comprehensive survey designed to advance understanding of the experiences of SGM adolescents (13-17 years of age). The survey, developed and distributed by the Human Rights Campaign, examined perceptions of familial acceptance regarding SGM identity during youth. Significant relationships were found between family acceptance, sexual orientation, and parental nativity (birthplace of parents in- or outside of the United States). The findings provide for a rich discussion about the implications for helping Latino SGM youth and educating Latino family members.",2021-04-30T13:48:57.471783+00:00,,,,"Tatiana Pineiro, Jack Simons, Matthew Gallo",psyarxiv

This study examined how adolescents with maltreatment histories who exhibit low levels of depression function in other domains during their adult years. Longitudinal trajectories of depression (across ages 13-32) in individuals with (n=3,809) and without (n=8,249) maltreatment histories were modeled in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. The same “Low,” “increasing,” and “declining” depression trajectories in both individuals with and without maltreatment histories were identified. Youths with maltreatment histories in the “low” depression trajectory reported lower romantic relationship satisfaction, more exposure to intimate partner and sexual violence, more alcohol abuse/dependency, and poorer general physical health compared to individuals without maltreatment histories in the same “low” depression trajectory in adulthood. Findings add further caution against labeling individuals as “resilient” based on a just single domain of functioning (low depression), as childhood maltreatment has harmful effects on a broad spectrum of functional domains.",2021-07-29T19:32:54.523341+00:00,"growth mixture modeling,resilience,maltreatment,add health,depression",,,"Kate Walsh, James Janford Li, Sharon S.

Method: Individuals in psychosomatic inpatient treatment (N = 488, 60.5% women) filled out the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Changes in both were investigated with correlations and t-tests. Linear regression analysis was used to test whether CTQ changes predicted symptom changes. Network analysis was performed to ascertain structural connections between somatic and emotional-cognitive depression symptoms and CTQ subscales before and after treatment. Results: After treatment (duration in days: M = 52.83, SD = 20.94), patients reported fewer depression symptoms (d = 0.84), while CTQ scores increased slightly (d = 0.11). Changes in the CTQ predicted recovery from depression symptoms in a statistically significant way (β = .133, p = .001). We did not observe changes in the overall network structure between baseline assessment and discharge. Conclusion: The findings suggest that the evaluation of past experiences can change over multiple weeks of psychotherapy. Further, these updated mental representations, indicating a greater recognition of past adversity, may contribute to symptom relief.",2022-08-07T07:15:12.618772+00:00,"memory,depression,mental representations,childhood trauma,psychotherapy",,,"Lina Krakau, Rüdiger Zwerenz, Mareike Ernst, Manfred E.

To combat biodiversity loss, it is essential to reduce demand for exotic pets and engage people in civic actions for wildlife conservation. Although messaging has been extensively used in conservation practice, little is known about how it can influence attitudes and various types of actions pertaining to the exotic pet trade. This study examined the impact of conservation messaging in the context of exotic pet ownership and wildlife entertainment visitation as common practices of the exotic pet trade. We randomly assigned participants in the U.S. to one of five messaging conditions: biodiversity loss and animal abuse (M1), zoonotic disease risks (M2), illegality (M3), social disapproval (M4), and neutral biological information as a control condition (M5). We found that all conservation messages (M1-M4) significantly decreased people’s favorable attitudes toward the exotic pet trade and their desire to visit wildlife entertainment. However, conservation messaging did not influence the desire for exotic pet ownership or intentions to take civic actions. Our findings highlight the potential of conservation messaging for attitude change and demand reduction for wildlife entertainment, but different approaches are necessary for promoting more effortful actions such as exotic pet ownership and civic actions.",2023-10-04T18:34:14.461376+00:00,"biodiversity conservation,transformative change,conservation psychology,global wildlife trade,conservation evidence,messaging,randomized control trial,civic action,attitude and behavior change",,,"Rumi Naito, Jiaying Zhao, Kai M.A. Chan",psyarxiv

findings indicate that the PCGQ is fairly unidimensional, as indexed using dynamic fit index
thresholds; internally consistent, as indexed by Cronbach’s alpha (α = .86); dependable, as
indexed by a test-retest correlation across two weeks (r = .71); and construct valid, as indexed by
its association with eight theoretically relevant variables, including acceptance of child emotional
abuse (r = .73), physical sadism (r = .61), and positive views towards the use corporal
punishment (r = .55). Conclusion: Taken together, the present results indicate that the PCGQ is

This cross-sectional study examined 365 current psilocybin users, analyzing differences in acute experiences, psychological outcomes, and substance co-use patterns. Participants were categorized into young (18-25), middle-aged (26–54), and older (55-77) adults. Results showed that younger participants reported significantly more adverse experiences while older adults had milder subjective effects. Despite differences in adverse experiences, age did not significantly impact mystical experiences, psychological insight, or psychological outcomes. Polysubstance use patterns also varied by age, as younger adults were more likely to co-use nicotine with psilocybin. Cannabis co-use specifically was associated with greater improvements in quality of life, anxiety, depression, and alcohol abuse, suggesting potential synergies between psilocybin and THC. These findings emphasize that age and cannabis co-use may modulate aspects of psilocybin’s acute effects and therapeutic outcomes.

E019B-3ED-EB0,Air Pollution and Impulsive Choice in Aging: Evidence from Delay Discounting,"Heightened air pollution exposure is associated with an increased risk for developing neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, yet it is unclear how pollution impacts the aging brain more broadly. Pollution studies in rodents have shown that higher air pollution exposure is associated with impulsive behavior and preference for immediate reward in delay discounting tasks. We examined this relationship in middle aged and older humans, by analyzing associations between residential pollution exposure and time-based reward preferences. One hundred-and-three (103) adults aged 40-80 completed a delay discounting task. We estimated long-term residential exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), a prominent air pollutant, using participant address information and satellite pollution data. We found that higher residential PM2.5 exposure was significantly associated with a higher preference for more immediate rewards, even after controlling for demographic factors including income and education. A preference for immediate rewards has been independently associated with higher risk of addictive behaviors, including substance abuse and gambling disorders, indicating that PM2.5 exposure may increase the emergence of these conditions. We discuss these results in detail along with potential underlying biological mechanisms, implications on human behavior, and future research directions.",2025-08-21,"Aging,Air Pollution,Delay Discounting,Impulsivity,PM2.5,Pollution",,,"David Victor Smith, Jeremy Mennis, Jamie-Nicole Luistro, Melanie Kos, Ingrid R.

E01CA-899-2C1,"Walking the Labyrinth: The Nonlinear Nature of C-PTSD Recovery—Core Memory, Dreams, and the Grey Phase Post-Betrayal Trauma","This paper presents a narrative review and theoretical synthesis of betrayal trauma through the lenses of memory reconstruction, identity disruption, and recovery. Drawing on psychological literature, including foundational work by Freyd, Herman, van der Kolk, and others, the paper maps the subjective experience of betrayal trauma—particularly in narcissistic abuse—as a nonlinear process of healing, akin to walking a labyrinth. The methodology employed is a synthesis of empirical studies, theoretical frameworks, and lived experience. The analysis highlights the collapse of perceptual trust, the reorganization of autobiographical memory, and introduces the novel concept of the “grey phase”—a distinct period marked by emotional numbness, psychic detachment, and dissociation. While this phase has been described implicitly in trauma literature, this paper explicitly names and frames it as a neurobiological and psychological intermission essential to recovery. This layered, compassionate, and academically grounded model enhances understanding of how trauma ruptures narrative identity and how healing entails its gradual reconstruction. The paper concludes that recovery reflects complex psychological integration rather than pathology.
Note on Perspective
While acknowledging the importance of lived experience in understanding betrayal trauma, this paper is primarily an academic synthesis of peer-reviewed psychological research.

E021C-933-A43,The Effects of Acute Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation on Attentional Bias in Pedophilic Disorder: A Pre-registered Pilot Study,"Objectives. Individuals with Pedophilic Disorder (PD) experience personal and interpersonal difficulties and are at risk of sexually offending against children. As such, innovative and empirically validated treatments are needed. Recent studies have indicated that men who have sexually offended against children (SOC) with PD display an automatic attention bias for child-related stimuli as well as reduced activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), a brain area involved in cognitive control, including control over sexual arousal. In this pre-registered pilot study, we are the first to investigate whether acutely increasing prefrontal activity could reduce the putative pedophilic attention bias. Materials and Methods. We delivered a single 20-minute session of active anodal vs. sham transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the left dlPFC to 16 SOC with PD and 16 matched healthy controls, while they performed a task requiring controlled attention to computer-generated images of clothed and nude children and adults. We collected responses unobtrusively by recording eye movements. Results. Our results did not support the presence of the expected automatic attention bias across outcome measures. Nonetheless, we found a response facilitation with child targets in patients and, unexpectedly, in controls, likely due to unwanted salience effects. Active vs. sham tDCS reduced this bias across groups, as indicated by a significant group*condition interaction (p = .04). However, no attentional bias and no tDCS effects on attentional responses to child and adult images emerged following tDCS. Conclusions. These results suggest enhanced cognitive control in response to salient stimuli during active tDCS. Thus, to assist future studies on neuromodulation in PD, we provide suggestions for design improvement.",2019-12-31T19:04:26.628861+00:00,"transcranial direct current stimulation,dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,child sexual abuse,pedophilia,cognitive control,attentional bias,eye movements,sexual offending,pedophilic disorder,sexual interest,visual sexual stimulation",,,"Andreas Mokros, Anastasios Ziogas, Pekka Santtila, Patrizia Pezzoli, Michael Seto, paul fedoroff, Natalia Jaworska",psyarxiv
E0084-958-9AF,"Co-production to understand on-line help-seeking for young people experiencing emotional abuse and neglect: building capabilities, adapting research methodology, evaluating involvement and impact","Background: Involving young people (YP) as co-researchers (YCoR) in mental health research is important for ethical and epistemological reasons. However, approaches to involve and evaluate ‘meaningful involvement’ in complex qualitative mental health research, and how to evaluate impacts (or change) for the co-researcher and the research is less well defined. Objectives: The co-produced research explored experiences of YP seeking help for emotional abuse and neglect via an on-line, peer-peer message board. This practical case study aims to evidence the meaningful role and impacts associated with YCoR involvement in sensitive and complex mental health research using flexible co-production. Methods: During the Covid-19 pandemic, we explored on- and off-line approaches and adapted research methodology to build relationships, knowledge, skills, and confidence of YCoR. The virtual involvement was evaluated against the five principles of co-production. Anonymous, continuous digital feedback, reflective practices and multiple dissemination outputs are used to evaluate the impact of the study on those involved and the research. Results: Ten members of NeurOX Young People’s Advisory Group (YPAG) were involved in the core project. Additional members were invited at later stages and in dissemination of outputs. We describe a supportive, scaffolded learning approach to build capabilities and embed the lived experience of YCoR in complex qualitative research. A digital blended approach was acceptable to YCoR, principles of co-production were met and the impact/benefits of involvement are described. To demonstrate the epistemological value of involving YP we evidence YPs capabilities for involvement and the ‘change’ or contribution YCoR made to the research through reflective practices. Conclusions: This case study demonstrates how flexible co-production with YCoR can be robust and responsive to balance ethical and epistemological impact in complex mental health research. Supportive, scaffolded practices and safe environments helped build the confidence and capacity of YCoRs to demonstrate valuable phenomenological insights in the analysis. YP’s perspectives on how they describe ‘meaningful’ and impactful involvement illustrate the reciprocal benefits gained through working together. Public contribution: This case study describes the YCoR involvement throughout the research and dissemination of outputs.

E01BB-7D5-93C,Obesity has limited behavioural overlap with addiction and psychiatric phenotypes,"Obesity is a widespread health condition1, likely driven by increased availability of inexpensive high-calorie food2. People vary in their behavioural response to food plenty. Such variation is likely driven by behavioural styles3,4, as behaviour accounts for entire food intake5. A prominent hypothesis is that people with obesity respond to rewards similarly to people with addictions such as alcohol abuse or smoking6,7. For instance, perceived overeating or “Uncontrolled Eating” (UE) is the most common obesity-associated personality trait8 and resembles the perceived loss of control seen in drug addiction. Likewise, both obesity and addictive behaviours have similar correlations with broad personality domains3. Here, we seek to empirically test whether obesity and UE overlap behaviourally with addiction and psychiatric disorders, collectively referred to as phenotypes. We test for behavioural similarity by linking the personality profiles of each phenotype. NEO Personality Inventory (NEO PI-R/3) profiles of 28 phenotypes were extracted from 22 studies, encompassing summary statistics from 18,611 unique participants. Obesity had moderate and UE high behavioural similarity with addictions. UE also overlapped behaviourally with most psychiatric phenotypes, whereas obesity was behaviourally similar with mood disorders and certain personality disorders. Facet-based phenotype profiles provided more information than domain-based profiles.",2018-06-06T17:39:24.320835+00:00,"body mass index,personality profile,behvioural similarity,domains,neo pi-r,bmi,factors,neo pi-3,personality correlation,personality disorders,food addiction,uncontrolled eating,facets,ue",,,"Uku Vainik, René Mõttus, Bratislav Misic, Alain Dagher, Yashar Zeighami, Andréanne Michaud",psyarxiv
E009A-639-43F,A weak scientific basis for gaming disorder: Let us err on the side of caution,"We greatly appreciate the care and thought that is evident in the ten commentaries that discuss our debate paper, the majority of which argued in favor of a formalized ICD-11 gaming disorder. We agree that there are some people whose play of video games is related to life problems. We believe that understanding this population and the nature and severity of the problems they experience should be a focus area for future research. However, moving from research construct to formal disorder requires a much stronger evidence base than we currently have. The burden of evidence and the clinical utility should be extremely high because there is a genuine risk of abuse of diagnoses. We provide suggestions about the level of evidence that might be required: transparent and preregistered studies, a better demarcation of the subject area that includes a rationale for focusing on gaming in particular versus a more general behavioral addictions concept, the exploration of non-addiction approaches, and the unbiased exploration of clinical approaches that treat potentially underlying issues such as depressive mood or social anxiety first. We acknowledge there could be benefits to formalizing gaming disorder, many of which were highlighted by colleagues in their commentaries, but we think they do not yet outweigh the wider societal and public health risks involved. Given the gravity of diagnostic classification and its wider societal impact, we urge our colleagues at the WHO to err on the side of caution for now and postpone the formalization.",2018-02-08T10:20:32.936461+00:00,"gaming disorder,world health organisation,international classification of disease-11,moral panic,mental disorders,diagnosis",,,"Jing Shi, Antonius J. van Rooij, Andrew K Przybylski, Daniel Kardefelt-Winther, Christopher J.

E01DC-70E-B3E,Response to vocal music in Angelman syndrome contrasts with Prader-Willi syndrome,"Parent-offspring conflict, or the conflict over resources between parents and their children due to differences in genetic relatedness, is the biological foundation for a variety of psychological phenomena, including sibling rivalry and child abuse. This form of conflict is particularly relevant to the domain of parental investment: the provisioning of resources to offspring by parents and alloparents. The kinship theory of genomic imprinting is the primary evolutionary explanation for the occurrence of specialized genetic expression in chromosomal domains relevant to phenotypic expression of parent-offspring conflict. Specifically, complementary parental contributions in the same region of the genome promote opposing parental demand behaviors. This theory predicts that people with genomic imprinting disorders will show alterations in traits and behaviors related to parental investment. In this paper, we apply this prediction to the psychological resource of parental attention, for which vocalizations in general, and music in particular, may be an honest signal. Individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome show increased physiological responses to music listening consistent with a reduced demand for parental investment. Here we report the complementary pattern necessary to support the theory: we find that individuals with Angelman syndrome demonstrate a relatively reduced physiological response to music, consistent with an increased demand for parental investment. In addition to presenting evidence of the value of applying the kinship theory of genomic imprinting to psychological phenomena, these data provide a comprehensive test of the theory that at least one aspect of human musical psychology evolved to mediate conflict over attentional demands between parents and offspring.",2018-08-13T03:03:57.776536+00:00,"parent-offspring conflict,genomic imprinting,angelman syndrome,evolution,music",,,"David Haig, Max Krasnow, Alena Egner, Samuel Mehr, Jennifer Kotler",psyarxiv
E00DC-B88-BA2,Mechanics of contingency-based Cognitive Bias Modification: pre-existing bias affects potency of active training but not placebo conditions.,"Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM) refers to various computerized training protocols aimed at modifying individuals’ automatic information processing patterns (cognitive biases). CBM protocols are commonly regarded as potential new treatments, targeting cognitive biases believed to be involved in, amongst others, anxiety, depression, substance abuse, disordered eating, pain perception, and insomnia. Designed to reward response tendencies associated with more desired information processing patterns trough repeated practice, CBM tasks tend to rely on a (hidden) contingency between stimulus valence and response rewards. In CBM studies, active training conditions are typically contrasted with control conditions lacking the contingency, often called 50/50 placebo. This report focusses on the wide-spread, and intuitive, notion that pre-existing bias may affect the contingency experienced by an individual engaging in a 50/50 placebo control condition thereby inadvertently rendering the intended placebo condition more potent. Employing probabilistic reasoning we conclude that, contrary to the often-forwarded notion, pre-existing bias cannot increase the potency of a 50/50 placebo condition. In contrast, we arrived at the unforeseen conclusion that lack of pre-existing bias may render an active training condition functionally similar to a placebo condition. In this paper we develop these arguments, review literature with respect to our assumptions, and discuss implications.",2018-10-03T16:24:52.812659+00:00,"placebo,task mechanics,cognitive training,cognitive bias modification",,,"Anne-Wil Kruijt, Per Carlbring",psyarxiv
E0012-955-CD3,"COVID-19, LOCKDOWN AND VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN IN HOMES","COVID-19 has imposed mandatory lockdowns in many countries including India. However, since the lockdown has been imposed, attention is being focused on its economic repercussions and on providing food and shelter to poor and migrants. But the pandemic has exposed vulnerabilities and created challenges at other fronts too. More specifically, women’s lack of autonomy in the patriarchal homes is further getting reduces when today, `homes’ which are no longer merely seen as comfort zones, but during the lockdown, homes are evolving as spaces where people are working from home and earning their livelihoods, children are attending classes and other activities are being coordinated. Violence in such homes against women and children is rising during the lockdown. Women and children trapped within homes with the perpetrators of violence are facing severe abuse. In order to combat the situation and to make homes as safe zones, special measures are required. The government needs to declare domestic violence as `essential services’ and must take steps to provide immediate relief to women and children. In the long term, the need is to address entrenched structural discrimination in order to ensure gender equality within homes. Lockdowns may be interpreted in different ways. One is to lockdown our collective imaginations and allow the pre-existing stereotypical gender notions to continue and reiterate, or it could be, to isolate the world from the patriarchal notions and to reimagine a violence free gender just world.",2020-05-21T05:45:35.724085+00:00,"lockdown,domestic violence,homes,covid-19,safety,india,prevention",,,Shalu Nigam,psyarxiv
E0252-DB7-B45,Changes in the Era of COVID-19: What Can We Learn from the Acceleration of Opioid Overdose Deaths in Maryland over 15 years,"This study tracks the number of accidental opioid overdose deaths (OOD) in Maryland from 2003-2020 and evaluates longitudinal trends, with a focus on increased mortality in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. All Marylanders with positive toxicology findings for opioids at the time of death from January 2003 through August 2020 (n = 1276) were included in analyses. Data were provided by the Maryland Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) which evaluates all unexpected deaths in the state. We explored longitudinal trends in the data and found a simple seasonal pattern. The number of OOD during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic was similar to the number of predicted by pre-pandemic data period. We compared opioid overdose decedents from spring 2019 with those who died in the spring of 2020 to assess the association of the COVID-19 pandemic with changes in manner of death and risk factors for opioid overdose. The likelihood of an overdose death being ruled intentional was lower during the pandemic, and there was a shift in patterns of substance use which may have reflected disrupted access to preferred substances of abuse and medication assisted treatment during the lockdown. More research that includes nationally representative data, extends beyond the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, and addresses mechanisms that drive change in substance use and treatment in the context of multiple national emergencies is needed.v",2021-03-01T22:23:49.913924+00:00,"overdose,covid-19,postmortem,opioid",,,"Paul Nestadt, Alison Athey",psyarxiv
E01B8-1B9-6D7,Boredom Makes Me Sick: Adolescents’ Boredom Trajectories and Their Health-Related Quality of Life,"Existing research shows consistent links between boredom and depression, somatic complaints, substance abuse, or obesity and eating disorders. However, comparatively little is known about potential psychological and physical health-related correlates of academic boredom. Evidence for such a relationship can be derived from literature, as boredom has adverse consequences in both, work and achievement-related settings. The present study investigates latent correlations of 1.484 adolescents’ (Mage 13.23) mathematics boredom scores at three time points during a semester and their Rasch scaled health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Moreover, we applied latent growth curve modeling to estimate boredom trajectories across the semester and determined the relationship between the latent growth parameters of student boredom and HRQoL in bivariate correlation analyses. Our results show that boredom is significantly negatively linked with all HRQoL dimensions (physical well-being, psychological well-being, autonomy and parent relation, social support and peers, school environment [SCH], and general HRQoL [GH]). Furthermore, stronger increases of boredom across the semester were negatively associated with SCH scores and GH. In conclusion, given that boredom is negatively linked with HRQoL and that stronger boredom growth is linked with more severe health-related problems, signs of academic boredom could be an early warning signal for adolescents’ potentially severe problems.",2021-04-19T14:47:02.749085+00:00,"achievement emotions,adolescents,boredom,health-related quality of life",,,"Anton Marx, Daniel Fiedler, Corinna Reck, Manuel M.

E00E2-568-CCF,Test-retest reliability of a new assessment to detect detailed temporal patterns of polysubstance use,"Objective: While polysubstance use is highly prevalent among people who use drugs, the field lacks a reliable assessment that can detect detailed temporal patterns of polysubstance use. This study assessed the test-retest reliability of the newly developed Polysubstance Use–Temporal Patterns Section (PSU-TPS). Methods: Participants who used cocaine plus alcohol and/or marijuana at least once in the past 30 days (n=48) were interviewed at baseline and approximately seven days later (retest) using the Substance Abuse Module (SAM) and the PSU-TPS. Reliability of PSU-TPS measures of quantity, frequency, and duration of polysubstance use was examined using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) and kappa tests. Results: Excellent reliability was observed for frequencies of concurrent polysubstance use patterns in the past 30 days (ICC range: 0.90–0.94) and quantity of alcohol use (ICC=0.83), and fair to good reliability was observed for duration in hours of substance use (ICC range: 0.52–0.73). Conclusion: Detailed information regarding cocaine, alcohol, and marijuana polysubstance use in the past 30 days can be reliably measured with the PSU-TPS. Data on the order and timing of polysubstance use at the hourly level will improve our understanding of the implications of sequential and simultaneous use patterns, which can help inform treatment and prevention efforts.",2021-11-05T20:20:42.525940+00:00,"cocaine,alcohol,polysubstance use,cannabis,reliability",,,"Lori A.

Method: Online studies used a questionnaire adapted to measure the broader autism phenotype as the base tool. First, a sensing presence item was added to check telepathy. Next, four personality measures relating to absorption, fantasy proneness, schizotypy, and thin boundaries were added in pairs to check the connections between items. Last, a new anomalous experience and psi questionnaire was created and checked. Results: Sensing a presence, most anomalous experiences, and most psi traits had considerable correlations to the broader autism phenotype. Sensing electromagnetic fields was the primary item contributing to sensing a presence. Conclusion: The study provides evidence that telepathy is the primary psi trait. The belief in telepathy and the ability to use telepathy are considerably more common in people with autistic traits. Anomalous experiences are also considerably more common in people with autistic traits, and many of the traits are correlated to each other. Broader autism traits generally are correlated to each other. Because of this, people must be cautious before assuming that a correlation to an autistic trait, an anomalous experience, or a psi trait is indicative of a causative link.",2022-09-07T19:48:35.595873+00:00,"autism,anomalous experience,telepathy,electromagnetic fields,linkage",,,Leif Ekblad,psyarxiv
E0153-5CB-7EA,Mental health considerations in children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic: a literature review,"Introduction: The global pandemic of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has had a significant impact on the mental health of populations across the world. However, the scope of this impact on children and adolescents has not yet been fully assessed. Methods: A literature search of the PubMed database was conducted using the terms “COVID-19”, “nCoV-2”, “children”, “adolescents”, “anxiety”, “depression”, “attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder”, “ADHD”, “autism”, “autism spectrum disorder”, “mental health” and “psychiatry” in various permutations and combinations. A total of 23 articles of direct relevance were retrieved, including four observational studies. Results: Emotional disturbances were noted in substantial numbers of children. In younger children (aged 3-6 years), these were mainly non-specific, such as clinginess, fearfulness and irritability. In older children, symptoms of anxiety and depression were noted in 19-22%. Children with pre-existing disorders, such as ADHD, were at risk of symptom exacerbation. Other concerns flagged in the literature included an elevated risk of unhealthy lifestyle behaviours, an increased risk of child abuse or neglect, and the need for special care in children with neurodevelopmental disorders. The challenges of delivering mental health services in the context of social distancing measures were highlighted. Conclusion: Emotional and behavioural symptoms are a common reaction in children and adolescents, perhaps more so in children with additional risk factors.

E01A0-399-60A,Emotion Regulation Strategy Choices Following Aversive Self-Awareness in People Who Engage in Nonsuicidal Self-Injury or Indirect Self-Injury,"Emotion regulation difficulties are implicated prominently in self-injury. Yet it is unclear how people who engage in different forms of self-injury attempt to regulate negative affect when multiple strategies are available to them. This laboratory-based study examined emotion regulation strategy choices in individuals who engage in non-suicidal self-injury (n=40), indirect forms of self-injury (disordered eating and substance abuse; n=46), and controls (n=48). Following a self-relevant stressor (negative autobiographical memory recall), participants selected one of six regulation strategies based on what they believed would most effectively alter their affect. Strategies spanned behavioral (physical pain, a snack, word activity) and non-behavioral (rumination, reappraisal, doing nothing) domains. Compared to controls, individuals who engage in NSSI and indirect self-injury were more likely to select behavioral strategies. In addition, those with NSSI and indirect self-injury were more likely than controls to choose physical pain and less likely to ruminate. Findings indicate that people with direct and indirect forms of self-injury alike are more likely to take action than to engage in further thought when experiencing aversive self-awareness, even when cognitive strategies are made salient. Results illuminate intervention targets for these clinical populations.",2021-09-01T03:15:43.752765+00:00,"indirect self-injury,emotion regulation choice,pain,nonsuicidal self-injury",,,"Jill M.

E0001-586-24B,Investigating the Effect of Methylphenidate on PHQ9 Responses in Patients with Major Depressive Disorder - A Research Protocol,"This research protocol outlines a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigating the effect of methylphenidate on Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ9) responses in patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). MDD is a complex psychiatric condition involving interactions between dopamine and serotonin neurotransmitter systems. Stimulants like methylphenidate influence the dopaminergic system and may impact certain MDD symptoms. The study aims to assess whether a single dose of methylphenidate affects specific items on the PHQ9 differently in MDD patients, with a focus on symptoms related to dopamine and serotonin dysregulation. The study will enroll adult patients diagnosed with MDD and a PHQ9 score of 10 or higher. Exclusion criteria include substance abuse, significant cardiovascular, hepatic or renal impairment, contraindicated medications, and adverse reactions to methylphenidate. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the experimental (methylphenidate) or placebo group. The intervention will be administered orally, and PHQ9 scores will be measured at baseline, post-intervention, and follow-up. The primary outcome measure will be the change in PHQ9 scores between the groups, with subgroup analysis focusing on specific items related to dopamine and serotonin dysregulation. Descriptive statistics and appropriate statistical tests will be used for data analysis. The study will adhere to ethical guidelines, obtaining informed consent and institutional review board approval. The results could provide insights into the neurobiological basis of MDD and improve the understanding and utilization of current pharmacological interventions, potentially leading to more targeted treatment approaches in the future.",2023-08-22T14:26:43.082349+00:00,"reclassification,serotonin,mental health,phq9,dopamine,methylphenidate,depression,classification",,,Roy Cohen,psyarxiv
E00D9-85B-46F,When religious leaders champion gender equity and religion is a strength: Empowering women and men to collectively mitigate gender-based violence,"Cha and Roberts (2019) suggest that marginalized groups can leverage identity-based strengths as resources to achieve desirable organizational outcomes. Scaling this up, we suggest that for a marginalized community, leveraging their cultural strengths as resources can also be an effective strategy to combat large, complex, and entrenched societal problems. In the aftermath of decades of war, gender-based violence (GBV) is a pressing concern in the Democratic Republic of Congo. To combat this, an intervention aimed to leverage the most influential cultural strengths in the region – religion and religious leadership - to energize social change. We tested whether such an approach was impactful in three critical areas: 1) GBV within marriage; 2) gender roles in the family; and 3) activism and male allyship in the community. Individuals from cities and rural areas in North Kivu and South Kivu who attended the year-long intervention (n = 100) and a matched control group (n = 100) completed a survey 4 years later. Results showed that compared to the control group, the intervention attendees reported significantly lower experience of emotional abuse, physical violence and sexual violence behaviors, endorsed more egalitarian gender roles and power sharing within the family. Finally, they exhibited activism in the community, and male allyship, grounded in positive masculinity. Findings demonstrate that interventions that emphasize and leverage cultural strengths offer a useful approach to combat entrenched social problems, even in extreme environments.",2023-08-12T21:43:58.324944+00:00,"women,religious leaders,democratic republic of congo,gender roles,cultural strengths,gender-based violence",,,"Meg A.

E01A2-F2A-6EC,Timing and severity of adverse life events: impact on substance use among high-risk adolescents,"Background – A robust association has been reported between childhood adverse life events (ALEs) and risky substance use in adolescence. It remains unclear, however, what impact of severity and timing of these ALEs is. Aims – We investigated the association between ALEs and substance use in adolescents. ALEs were operationalized as broad (e.g., moving, getting bullied, family sickness) or severe (physical and/or sexual abuse). First, we examined lifetime ALEs, followed by an investigation into their timing. Methods – The sample consisted of 909 adolescents (aged 12-18 years) from a cohort oversampled on high levels of emotional and behavioral problems. The primary caregiver indicated which ALEs each adolescent experienced across their lifetime. Adolescents self-reported on number and frequency of substances used. Poisson and ordinal regression models were used to model the associations. Results – The associations between lifetime ALEs and a substance used were observed only for severe life events (incidence rate ratio 1.18 [1.03, 1.35], p = 0.02). When investigating timing, severe events after the age of 12 predicted number of substances used (IRR 1.36 [1.13, 1.63], p &lt; .001). Conclusions – Recent ALEs (occurring after age 12) seem to have considerable impact on substance use.

E00BB-66A-49B,Self-acceptance and Purpose in life are Mechanisms Linking Adverse Childhood Experiences to Mortality Risk,"Objective: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with increased risk of premature mortality, but it is not clear why. Individuals with ACEs tend to have lower self-acceptance and purpose in life, which may be pathways between ACEs and risk of premature mortality. As such, we tested whether purpose and self-acceptance are mechanisms that link ACEs to mortality risk. Methods: We used the Midlife in the United States Survey (N = 6218; M ± SD = 46.89 ± 12.94 years) to test whether these factors were indirect pathways (mediated) the association between ACEs and mortality hazards over 24 years of follow-up. We employed a comprehensive ACEs measure that included 20 possible childhood adversities including emotional and physical abuse, household instability, socioeconomic climate, and ill health. Results: ACEs significantly increased mortality risk, HR=1.028, 95% CI (1.008, 1.047), p = 0.006. Self-acceptance and purpose accounted for an estimated 15% and 4% of the ACEs-mortality relation respectively. These effects withstood a range of adjustments and sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: ACEs may impact mortality risk partially through lower self-acceptance and purpose during adulthood. Given that self-acceptance and purpose may change through intervention, these factors may be useful targets for individuals with ACEs that could lead to a longer life.",2023-05-24T11:29:28.351366+00:00,"self-acceptance,socioeconomic status,adverse childhood experiences,mortality,purpose,adversity",,,"Nicholas A.

E016B-DFD-809,"The Effects of Childhood Trauma on Marriage and Relationships: A Review of the Theoretical, Clinical, and Empirical Literature","Childhood trauma, encompassing emotional, physical, and sexual maltreatment, has profound and lasting effects on adult romantic relationships. This review synthesizes findings from recent studies to elucidate the mechanisms by which childhood trauma impacts marital and relationship satisfaction. Research indicates that childhood emotional maltreatment (CEM) undermines relationship quality by fostering negative characteristics such as decreased compassionate goals and increased hostility towards partners. Longitudinal studies reveal that individuals with a history of childhood maltreatment exhibit lower relationship satisfaction, with effects intensifying over time. Specifically, a study found that 68% of individuals with childhood trauma reported significant relationship distress compared to 38% of those without such experiences. Additionally, childhood trauma is linked to insecure attachment patterns, including anxious and avoidant attachment, which mediate the relationship between trauma and poor relationship quality. Depression and anxiety, often stemming from childhood trauma, further exacerbate these issues, leading to lower quality intimate relationships. Dyadic studies highlight significant actor and partner effects, indicating that both individuals’ trauma histories contribute to overall couple satisfaction. For instance, couples where both partners had a history of trauma reported 25% lower relationship satisfaction compared to couples without such histories. This review underscores the importance of addressing childhood trauma in therapeutic settings to improve relationship outcomes and break the cycle of abuse.",2024-10-25T23:32:39.921701+00:00,"clinical,marriage,empirical,adverse childhood experiences,childhood trauma,relationship,theoretical,childhood emotional maltreatment",,,Anthony Ayo Arogbofa,psyarxiv
E016A-F30-72E,"The Structure of Psychopathology Among Young Adults in Kenya, Namibia, and South Africa","The generalizability of psychopathology constructs across human populations is often assumed, but most evidence comes from Western contexts. The ‘majority world’ (Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East) is underrepresented in psychopathology research. Efforts to reorganize mental disorder classifications provide an opportunity to better integrate evidence from majority-world contexts. In this study we investigated the coviariance structure of common mental health problems among young adults in Kenya, Namibia, and South Africa. The findings suggest a relatively consistent structure across countries, characterized by both universal and culturally specific features. Internalizing consistently emerged as robust higher-order dimensions, with fear and dysregulated sleep, disinhibited negative affect, and substance abuse consistently identified as narrower disorder dimensions. Variation was observed across countries in the alignment of anger symptoms. In Namibia and Kenya, anger was more closely associated with internalizing disorders, whereas in South Africa, it aligned more strongly with externalizing disorders.

E0021-706-83B,"The Structure of Psychopathology Among Young Adults in Kenya, Namibia, and South Africa","The generalizability of psychopathology constructs across human populations is often assumed, but most evidence comes from Western contexts. The ‘majority world’ (Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East) is underrepresented in psychopathology research. Efforts to reorganize mental disorder classifications provide an opportunity to better integrate evidence from majority-world contexts. In this study we investigated the coviariance structure of common mental health problems among young adults in Kenya, Namibia, and South Africa. The findings suggest a relatively consistent structure across countries, characterized by both universal and culturally specific features. Internalizing consistently emerged as robust higher-order dimensions, with fear and dysregulated sleep, disinhibited negative affect, and substance abuse consistently identified as narrower disorder dimensions. Variation was observed across countries in the alignment of anger symptoms. In Namibia and Kenya, anger was more closely associated with internalizing disorders, whereas in South Africa, it aligned more strongly with externalizing disorders. In contrast to the majority of findings in the West, inattention/hyperactivity loaded primarily on internalizing and showed inconsistent loadings across contexts. These results highlight the intricate interplay between universal and culture-specific aspects of psychopathology and emphasize the importance of incorporating diverse global samples to better distinguish the more universal from the more context-specific aspects of psychopathology.

E00A2-EB3-2A1,Friendship Stress Buffering in Young People with Childhood Adversity,"Around 60% of young people worldwide experience at least one form of childhood adversity, such as abuse, neglect, bullying, or poverty. These stressful experiences can have long-lasting effects and significantly increase the risk of mental health problems. To aid future intervention and prevention efforts, my doctoral research examined how childhood adversity contributes to mental health difficulties, and whether and how friendships can help protect against these effects.

Using a combination of literature reviews, behavioral studies, and brain imaging research, my colleagues and I found that young people with more severe childhood adversity were at greater risk of social isolation, being harmed or harming others, and developing mental health problems. This was partly due to differences in how they process and perceive stress. In addition, we found that those with strong, high-quality friendships reported lower stress perceptions and fewer mental health difficulties.

These findings matter for two key reasons. First, they detail how childhood adversity increases vulnerability to mental health problems. Second, they demonstrate that high-quality friendships play a critical protective role in mental health – and help explain how, by reducing stress perceptions. Hence, helping young people build and maintain supportive friendships could be an important way to promote mental health, especially for those who have faced childhood adversity.",2025-07-17,,,,Maximilian König,psyarxiv
E0205-946-377,Chemsex-Related Risk: Profiling and Mapping Psychological Vulnerability Over Time,"Two studies mapped psychological vulnerability to chemsex engagement and related risks over time among men who have sex with men. Study 1 (N = 503) used latent profile analysis to map psychological traits and identity process associated with chemsex engagement and mental and sexual health risks. Study 2 (N = 176) examined 12-month transitions in profile memberships and associations with the same outcomes. Study 1 identified four profiles, labelled as Impulsive, Insecure, Self-Centered, and Withdrawn, ranging from the low-risk Self-Centered, characterized by high wellbeing and recreational chemsex, to the high-risk Impulsive, marked by disinhibition and risky engagement. Profiles differed in mental health, substance abuse, and sexual risk, with the Impulsive reporting the most problematic outcomes. Profile membership was generally stable over time, except for the Insecure and the Withdrawn, who significantly transitioned to the Impulsive and the Self-Centered, respectively. The Withdrawn who transitioned to the Self-Centered showed improved sleep quality. These findings are novel and improve our understanding of who engages in chemsex, when vulnerability is greatest, and why certain individuals experience greater mental health difficulties and poorer sexual health outcomes. Trajectories for tailored harm reduction are discussed, including intervention that accounts for psychological vulnerability and identity process.",2025-09-17,,,,"Ismaël Maatouk, Martin Robinson, Nadia Badran, Cherie Armour, Ignacio Labayen de Inza, Emanuele Fino, Kostas A.

E00AA-94B-1B3,Seeing through the borderline lens: how family perceptions and attributional bias shape borderline personality disorder,"Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is marked by emotional dysregulation and interpersonal instability, with family environment recognized as a key etiological factor. While previous research has examined family characteristics from either the patient’s or relative’s perspective, this study systematically compares patient-family dyads using genogram analysis and attributional bias assessment. We investigated the relationship between symptom severity, attributional biases, and perceptions of emotional relationships and risk behaviors (ERRB) from both perspectives. Six female patients with BPD receiving outpatient treatment in Brazil and six family members participated. Data were collected remotely and included a BPD symptom measure, an attributional bias task, and semi-structured interviews for genogram construction exploring family ERRB. Patients showed higher intentionality scores (p = 0.0357) and more reports of physical abuse (p = 0.0235), whereas family members reported more distant/poor relationships (p = 0.0198). Categorical symptom severity correlated with suspected alcohol and drug use (p = 0.0117), and personalization bias predicted continuous symptom severity (β = 0.16, p = 0.0283). Qualitative analysis identified significant relationships within each dyad and the family members involved. These findings highlight how attributional biases and ERRB shape BPD symptoms and suggest that integrating family narratives with cognitive assessments enriches clinical understanding of underlying mechanisms.",2025-09-18,"Borderline personality disorder,attributional bias,dyadic research,emotional relationships,family relations,genogram,risk behavior",,,"Tiago Figueiredo, Erlei Sassi Junior, Fernanda celeste de oliveira Martins Sassi, Claudia Berlim de Mello, Camila Chagas, Francisco Lotufo Neto, Ana Carolina Soares Marinho, José Carlos Galduroz",psyarxiv
E01C6-3AD-111,Personality Correlates of Dispositional Forgiveness: A Direct Comparison of Interpersonal and Self-Forgiveness Using Common Transgression Scenarios,"Although the personality correlates of dispositional interpersonal forgiveness (forgiveness of others) have been well characterized, those of dispositional self-forgiveness are less well understood. Moreover, when the personality correlates are examined for both types of forgiveness, the comparison has been based on participants’ self-report ratings on questionnaires. The current study sought to address these gaps in the literature by adopting a scenario-based approach, which has been used less frequently, especially in self-forgiveness research. A total of 160 participants read six fictional scenarios, each describing a severe transgression, from the perspective of the transgressor (self-forgiveness, n = 78) or the victim (interpersonal forgiveness, n = 82) of the transgression, and then responded to several items assessing different facets of forgiveness (avoidance, revenge, and benevolence). Participants’ personality (Big Five) and explanatory style were also assessed. Consistent with prior literature, agreeableness and neuroticism generally predicted different facets of interpersonal forgiveness. These two personality traits also predicted facets of self-forgiveness, but, additionally, conscientiousness and one’s tendency to internalize failure (the personal component of explanatory style) uniquely predicted self-forgiveness, especially avoidance motivations. These results point to both similarities and differences in the personality correlates for interpersonal and self-forgiveness. As a secondary, more exploratory aim, the current study compared the results from our scenario-based assessment of forgiveness to those based on a commonly used questionnaire, the Other and Self subscales of the Heartland Forgiveness Scale (HFS). As expected, the Other subscale of the HFS were associated with levels of interpersonal forgiveness assessed with our transgression scenarios, but, surprisingly, so were the HFS Self subscale. Moreover, the Self subscale was not associated with levels of self-forgiveness assessed with transgression scenarios, except for avoidance motivations. These results suggest that scenario-based and questionnaire-based methods may capture different facts of forgiveness and cannot be used interchangeably, especially for the assessment of self-forgiveness. More generally, the current study illustrates the importance of conducting direct within-study comparisons of interpersonal and self-forgiveness as well as of different assessment methods to better understand the similarities and differences between the two types of forgiveness.",2023-05-07T19:45:51.771290+00:00,"neuroticism,explanatory style,agreeableness,interpersonal forgiveness,self-forgiveness,big five,conscientiousness,forgiveness",,,"Nicholas Carruth, Lucas Hampton, Akira Miyake, John Lurquin",psyarxiv

This review aims to examine the veracity of the existing psychological, sexological, and legal literature in relation to doll ownership. Recent findings Strong views exist across the spectrum of potential socio-legal positions on sex doll ownership. However, there is an almost total lack of empirical analyses of the psychological characteristics or behavioral implications of doll ownership. As such, existing arguments appear to represent the philosophical positions of those scholars expressing them, rather than being rooted in any objective evidence base.

E0071-CA1-235,The Effect of Sex and Perpetrator-Victim Relationship on Perceptions of Domestic Homicide,"Previous research on how stereotypes affect perceptions of intimate partner violence and domestic homicide has found that violence committed by men is perceived as more severe and judged more harshly than violence committed by women. The present mock jury study investigated how perpetrator sex (male or female), crime type (familicide or filicide), and relatedness between perpetrator and child victims (biological or step) affect laypeople’s perceptions of the appropriate consequence of the crime, the reason for the offence, responsibility of the perpetrator, the likelihood of certain background factors being present, and the risk of future violence. One hundred sixty-seven university students read eight fictive descriptions of cases of multiple-victim domestic homicides, in which the sex of the perpetrator, the crime type, and the relatedness between the perpetrator and the child victims were manipulated. We found that participants recommended equally severe punishments to and placed the same amount of responsibility on male and female offenders. Female offenders were, however, regarded as mentally ill to a larger extent and perceived more likely to have been victims of domestic violence compared to male offenders. Male offenders, on the other hand, were seen as more likely to have committed domestic violence in the past, having been unemployed, have substance abuse, hold aggressive attitudes, and commit violent acts in the future. Participants also perceived offenders killing biological children as more mentally ill than offenders killing stepchildren. The present study extends the literature on the possible effect of stereotypes on decision making in psychiatric and judicial contexts.",2018-04-05T09:26:27.016307+00:00,"sex,family relationships,stereotypes,homicide,domestic violence",,,"Tuulia Malén, Jan Antfolk, Johanna K.

E00F0-DC3-3F8,Giving Voice to Silence: Empowerment and Disempowerment in the Developmental Shift from Trauma ‘Victim’ to ‘Survivor-Advocate’,"In the past several years, a public conversation in the United States about interpersonal violence has flourished, sustained by the work of advocates who are themselves survivors. This surge in public sharing of trauma stories is a rhetorical form of resistance to ideologies in mainstream American culture that impose silence on survivors (e.g., the “just world” belief). However, the developmental progression from trauma ‘victim’ to empowered public ‘survivor/advocate’ accommodates to dominant American cultural preferences that stories of adversity have a redemptive story line. In a redemptive story, negative experiences are followed by something positive (e.g., personal growth, lessons learned, strength gained). In this paper, we draw from theory and the sparse relevant literature across multiple disciplines to conceptualize when and for whom the redemptive storying of trauma (or, redemptive master narrative) is available, advantageous, and systemically encouraged. Among the proposed advantages of redemptive storying are its psychological health benefits; potential to empower self and others; promotion of meaning-making, mission, and communal solidarity; and the larger social/political changes that can emerge from giving voice to silenced experiences. Proposed challenges to redemptive storying include layers of societal oppression and marginalization that shape the redemption stories of many survivor-advocates; ongoing connection to or dependence on relationships and communities that enable abuse; and the reality of historical trauma and other forms of intergenerational trauma, which complicate the linear, individualistic story of redemption. With this theory-driven framework, we wish to promote compassion for survivors, along with interdisciplinary, inclusive, and intersectional research in this understudied area.",2019-08-13T20:18:19.000405+00:00,"social systems,survivors,trauma disclosure,gender-based violence,narrative psychology,master narratives,advocates,sexual violence,trauma,resilience,lifespan development,interpersonal violence,#metoo,sociocultural differences,redemption,advocacy",,,"Kate C.

E012F-0C9-4F4,tDCS targeting the Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex reduces reactive aggression and modulates electrophysiological responses: A HD-tDCS/EEG randomized controlled trial in a forensic population.,"BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that impairments in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) in forensic patients who also abuse cocaine and alcohol play a crucial role in aggression. However, current treatment in forensic patients is found not to be effective. A promising intervention is to modulate the vmPFC by transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS). This study aimed to investigate high definition (HD)-tDCS as an intervention to increase empathic abilities in order to reduce violent behavior in forensic patients. In addition, using electroencephalography (EEG), we examined the effects of tDCS on the event-related potentials P3 and LPP in reaction to situations that depict victims of aggression (i.e. empathy). METHODS: Fifty male forensic substance use patients (25 in the active and 25 in the sham condition) were tested in a double-blind placebo-controlled study. The patients received HD-tDCS two times a day for 20 min for five consecutive days. Before and after the intervention, the patients completed self-reports, performed the Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm (PSAP), and EEG was recorded while patients performed an empathy task. RESULTS: Results showed a significant decrease in aggressive responses on the PSAP and a decrease in self-reported reactive aggression in the active tDCS group. Additionally, we found an increase in LPP amplitude after tDCS intervention in the active tDCS group compared to the sham group. No effects on the P3 were found. CONCLUSION: Current findings are the first to find effects of tDCS modulating aggression and electrophysiological responses in forensic patients, thereby showing the potential for tDCS as an intervention in forensic mental healthcare.",2020-10-05T07:11:08.078511+00:00,"transcranial direct current stimulation,empathy,forensic patients,aggression,neuromodulation,electroencephalography",,,"Carmen S.

E00CC-5F0-8CD,Predictors of Symptom Course in Alcohol Use Disorder,"Objective: Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) has traditionally been viewed as a chronic, progressive, relapsing disorder (Jellinek, 1960; National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2018). However, little is known about the course of individual AUD criteria. To the extent that individual symptoms represent the focus of some treatments (e.g., withdrawal, craving), understanding the course of specific symptoms, and individual differences in symptom course, can inform treatment efforts and future research directions. Method: The current study examined 34,653 participants form Wave 1 (2001-2002) and Wave 2 (2003-2004) of the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC; Grant, Moore, &amp; Kaplan, 2003; Grant, Kaplan, and Stinson, 2005), using logistic regression to analyze the extent to which AUD symptom course is predicted by heavy alcohol consumption, family history of alcoholism, and lifetime diagnosis of Conduct Disorder. Results: The course of all AUD symptoms was significantly influenced by all four external criteria, with the magnitude of the prediction varying across different symptoms and different aspects of course. Conclusion: The strength of the relationship appeared to be related to the theoretical proximity of a given predictor to AUD symptomatology, with heavy drinking being the strongest and family history of AUD being the weakest. The course of all AUD symptoms was strongly associated with the prevalence of the given symptom in the overall sample. Future work should include examining the interchangeability of AUD symptoms and considering heavy alcohol consumption as a criterion for AUD diagnosis.",2020-10-25T20:35:01.621427+00:00,"diagnosis,alcohol use disorder,symptom course,alcohol use disorder course",,,"Michaela Hoffman, William Conlin, Alvaro Vergés, Douglas Steinley, Kenneth J.

E0221-B1D-6A6,"Procrastination and Anxiety among Indian college students: The role of perceived parenting styles, locus of control and self efficacy","The purpose of the present study was to investigate the factors associated with procrastination and anxiety, both of which can impact a student’s college experience significantly. The research question we examined was whether perceived parenting styles, locus of control and self-efficacy could predict anxiety and procrastination in our sample of college students. The participants were college students in India (N = 156), who responded to an online survey with self-report questionnaires measuring the variables of interest. The results found that procrastination was significantly correlated with general (r = -0.597) and social self-efficacy (r = -0.241), and locus of control (r = 0.276), while anxiety was significantly correlated with these variables (r = -0.420, r = -0.248, r = 0.294, respectively) and the acceptance-involvement dimension of parenting (r = -0.227). A multivariate regression was conducted with procrastination and anxiety as outcome variables, locus of control, social and general self-efficacy, parental acceptance-involvement, parental strictness-supervision, and helicopter parenting included as covariates and gender, history of child sexual abuse, history of parental neglect, and ongoing treatment for a mental health concern included as factors. These predictors significantly contributed to the variance in procrastination (R2 = 0.3826) and anxiety (R2 = 0.4009). General self-efficacy emerged as the only significant predictor ( = -0.612) of procrastination in the model described, while gender ( = -0.117), ongoing treatment for a mental health concern ( = 0.147) and general self-efficacy ( = -0.451) emerged as significant predictors of anxiety. These results suggest that general self-efficacy can be a variable of further investigation for interventions targeted towards improving procrastination and anxiety among college students.",2021-02-07T11:35:08.197879+00:00,,,,"Nayantara Vohra, Simantini Ghosh",psyarxiv
E011E-229-A35,"Development and Initial Validation of the Betrayal Blindness Questionnaires (BBQs): Past Memory, Current Memory, and Rotating Betrayal Blindness Questionnaires","Emerging adults of Color are at increased risk for interpersonal trauma, including physical, sexual, and emotional abuse (Porter &amp; Williams, 2011). Understanding victims’ awareness of the existence and impact of their own trauma history is important for research and clinical work. However, because of trauma awareness processes (e.g., underreporting), it is challenging to accurately measure awareness of trauma. Based on betrayal trauma theory (Freyd, 1996), the concept of rotating betrayal blindness theorizes that awareness of past trauma may shift across contexts and time (Noll &amp; Gómez, 2013). The purpose of the current study is to provide an initial validation of the Betrayal Blindness Questionnaires (BBQs) among a sample of emerging adults of Color with trauma histories using exploratory factor analysis (EFA). With its three questionnaires assessing past memory (PM-BBQ), current memory (CM-BBQ), and rotating betrayal blindness (R-BBQ), the BBQs measure the past and present impact of traumatic events, as well as how this impact may vary according to the theory of rotating betrayal blindness. Participants (N = 155) were college students of Color who completed the one-hour online survey at a location of their own choosing. Based on the EFA, the R-BBQ retained 19 items across 4 factors, the PM-BBQ retained 22 items across 4 factors, and the CM-BBQ retained18 items across 4 factors. The questionnaires demonstrated adequate to excellent reliability (α = .66-.95).

E0135-703-A3B,"Gender specificity of self- stigma, public stigma, and help-seeking sources of mental disorders in youths","Self-stigma and public stigma are major barriers to seeking help for mental health problems and they are sensitive to gender. This study investigated self-stigma and public stigma toward peers with mental disorders in a youth sample and evaluated gender differences in stigma scores. The sample consists of 1,113 youths (M = 16.96 years, SD = 1.88, 56% female) that were randomly assigned to a self-evaluation or a peer-evaluation condition using a vignette describing symptoms fulfilling DSM-5 diagnostic criteria of one of five mental disorders (depressive disorder, social anxiety disorder, ADHD, substance abuse, and bulimia). Stigma was assessed using a questionnaire assessing eight emotional reactions and attitudes toward the protagonist in the vignette. Stigma scores were significant higher in the self-evaluation condition (self-stigma) compared to the peer-evaluation condition (public stigma) in terms of a higher minimization of symptoms, higher blame for mental disorders, less pity and (self) compassion. Results indicated that prior or current experience of psychotherapy and familiarity with people seeking psychotherapy were predictors for less blame for mental disorders for the peer-evaluation but not for the self-evaluation. Gender-differences were found for public stigma, not for self-stigma. Interventions that aim to increase help-seeking intentions in youths might focus more on the reduction of self-stigma in addition to public stigma. Gender-sensitive approaches should be developed to achieve a decrease in self-stigma and public stigma especially in male youths.",2022-03-07T11:36:56.564175+00:00,"psychotherapy,mental disorder,public stigma,adolescents,youths,help-seeking,self-stigma",,,"Simone Pfeiffer, Tina In-Albon",psyarxiv

The current study used latent profile analyses in Chinese (N = 544) and UK (N = 589) samples to identify childhood psychological maltreatment profiles (i.e., profiles of psychological abuse, psychological neglect, and psychological non-support) in different country contexts, and their associations with a range of mental health (i.e., depression, anxiety, anger, physical aggression, verbal aggression, and hostility), and broader well-being (i.e., self-esteem) outcomes. Four profiles were identified in both samples, but their nature differed between the Chinese sample (“Psychological Non-support”, “Low-Maltreated”, “High-Maltreated”, and “Severe-Maltreated”) and the UK sample (“Low-Maltreated”, “Moderate-Maltreated”, “High-Maltreated”, and “Severe-Maltreated”). Individuals in the “Psychological Non-support” in China and “Low-Maltreated” class in the UK displayed better mental health outcomes – lower levels of depression, anxiety, and aggression, and higher self-esteem. In contrast, individuals in the “Sever-Maltreated” profiles in both the Chinese and UK samples displayed poorer mental health outcomes – higher depression, anxiety, and aggression, and lower self-esteem. Interventions and prevention efforts are needed for individuals categorized in the “Sever-Maltreated” profile.

E00DD-19F-2F0,Experience of typical variations in stressors impact hippocampal structure and functional connectivity in childhood,"Abuse and maltreatment have been shown to negatively impact the developing brain through the HPA-axis, the body’s central stress response system. Theoretically, similar pathophysiology occurs when children experience more moderate forms of stress (i.e., changing schools); however, evidence for this association is lacking. To address this question, the current study explored the effects of typical variations in stressful events on the development of the hippocampus, a brain region susceptible to stress. Data from a 3-year accelerated longitudinal sample of 79 4- and 6-year-old children were used to assess the impact of stressful events on the development of hippocampal subfield volumes and functional connectivity. In the 4-year-old cohort, stressful experiences were related to increased functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the insula, a region important for emotional processing. In the 6-year-old cohort, stressful experiences were related to smaller CA1 and CA2-4/DG subfield volumes. Results from analyses comparing cohorts showed that there was a significantly greater effect of stressful events on CA2-4/DG volume in 6- compared to 4-year-old children. Overall, these findings provide evidence of the impact of typical variations in stressful events on the structure and function of the hippocampus and highlight the region and time-dependent nature of these stress effects. They also highlight the importance of understanding how brain development is impacted by stress in all forms because stress-related alterations in hippocampal development have been linked to variations in cognitive processes (e.g., memory) and risk for psychopathology (e.g., major depressive disorder).",2022-09-29T15:12:35.345963+00:00,"early life stress,hippocampus,mri,childhood,brain development",,,"Morgan Botdorf, Tracy Riggins",psyarxiv
E0089-606-0B1,The Impacts of Child-Mentor Relationships on Child Mental Health,"With mental health being a field that is becoming progressively more familiar and researched in depth, an important subject of interest that should be addressed is child mental health, and the different factors that can influence it. In this paper, we use a dataset from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Data Archive to analyze the impacts of child-mentor relationships on child mental health. Previous studies have come to similar conclusions: positive parent-student and teacher-student relationships often lead to signs of positive mental health in children. To expand upon these past findings, we used different measures of mental health and relationship qualities to create a predictive model. We conducted classification and coefficient weight analyses to see how strong of an impact different variables representing indicators of healthy relationships had on different aspects of child mental health. This information was used to create predictions of future cases. Like previous studies, we found that there was a general pattern that showed that good child-mentor relationships, defined specifically by the frequency of praise and fights, had an overall positive impact on child mental health, specifically when it came to symptoms of depression. Furthermore, parents seemed to have stronger impacts on child mental health than teachers did. Limitations include possibly biased respondents who may not be representative of the greater population, as well as the specificity of the variables that were chosen. Going forward, further steps to analyze different datasets and deepen the scope of the research will be helpful in finding patterns and developing more detailed conclusions.",2022-10-10T03:56:12.575109+00:00,,,,Samantha Kim,psyarxiv
E01A0-A66-ACF,Positive autobiographical memory recall does not influence temporal discounting: an internal meta-analysis of experimental studies,"People tend to discount the value of future rewards as the delay to receiving them increases. This phenomenon, known as temporal discounting, has been proposed to underlie many impulsive behaviors, such as drug abuse and overeating. Furthermore, steep temporal discounting has been observed in people with addiction and other impulsive disorders. Given the potential role of temporal discounting in maladaptive behaviors, there have been many efforts to find experimental manipulations that reduce temporal discounting, with the hope that these manipulations can be adapted into interventions with clinical utility. One class of manipulations that has held some promise involves recalling positive autobiographical memories prior to making intertemporal choices. Just as imagining positive personal events in the future has been shown to reduce temporal discounting, a few studies have shown that recalling positive events from the past reduces temporal discounting, especially if memory retrieval evokes positive affective states, such as gratitude and nostalgia. However, we failed to replicate these findings. Here we present a meta-analysis combining data from 14 studies done by the authors (n = 603) that involved within-subjects positive memory recall-based manipulations. In each study, temporal discounting was assessed using a monetary intertemporal choice task. The average effect size was small and not significantly different from zero. This finding helps elucidate the neurocognitive mechanisms of temporal discounting; whereas engaging the episodic memory system to imagine future events might promote more patience, engaging the episodic memory system to imagine past events does not.",2023-11-06T18:28:22.096334+00:00,"positive memory recall,gratitude,temporal discounting,nostalgia,intertemporal choice",,,"Karolina Lempert, Trishala Parthasarathi, Joe Kable, Samantha Linhares, Natalia Ruh",psyarxiv
E007C-73B-502,"Psychological Distress, Coping Styles, and Suicidal Ideation in Sexual Orientation Minority College Students","Previous research has indicated that those who identify as sexual orientation minorities experience symptoms of psychological distress at higher rates and have higher levels of suicidal ideation than their straight peers. Researchers have identified specific coping mechanisms that reduce symptoms of psychological distress in SOM individuals with the potential of also reducing feelings of suicidality. Coping mechanisms are behaviors that individuals engage in when confronted with a stressful situation, and they are divided into two categories: adaptive and maladaptive. Adaptive strategies can be beneficial for one's mental and physical health, however SOMs more commonly use maladaptive coping strategies. The current study aimed to examine the relation between psychological distress and suicidality in SOM college students and identify which coping mechanisms moderate this relation. This was done to identify adaptive strategies that are effective, and understand what maladaptive strategies are currently utilized by the population. It was predicted that psychological distress would be positively correlated with suicidality, and that adaptive coping mechanisms as moderators would be more effective at reducing the relation than maladaptive ones in the SOM student population. The sample included 138 SOM college students from the continental United States ranging in age from 18 to 56. Data were collected through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform. Findings indicated that the only coping mechanism that moderated the psychological distress-suicidality relation was substance abuse. Although additional research is required, this study is beneficial to the understanding of the way SOMs cope with psychological distress and the suicidality-related implications.",2024-01-16T18:54:01.276291+00:00,,,,"Emily K.

E01AE-712-DC1,The digital witness: Exploring gestural misinformation in tele-forensic interviews with 5-8-year-old children,"In 2016, approximately half of children aged 2-17 worldwide experienced child abuse. This number increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, with timely face-to-face eyewitness interviews disrupted due to social distancing. While live-link interviews have been successful in legal and medical contexts, its potential for eyewitness interviews remains insufficiently studied, particularly in terms of non-verbal misinformation. This study explored tele-forensic interviewing (tele-FI) as an alternative to face-to-face interviews, with a focus on the gestural misinformation effect (GME). Forty-seven children were recruited ranging in age from 5- to 8-years-old (M=6 years 11 months). Comparisons to face-to-face conditions were based on prior work by the author (N=63, M= 7 years 2 months). Results find support for the GME during tele-FI, with 1.23 misinformation details recorded on average and tele-FI showing a similar response pattern as face-to-face interviews. Accuracy was shown to be comparable in tele-FI (M=16.21) compared to face-to-face interviews (M=14.02), with a notable increase in the amount of relevant information provided in the tele-FI condition. Age did not affect interview outcomes. This study provides further evidence for tele-FI as a viable alternative to face-to-face interviews and offers the first exploration of the GME in tele-FI. Discussion focuses on the benefits of tele-FI and the implications for police interview guidelines.",2024-03-14T11:24:10.357709+00:00,"children,tele-forensic interviewing,gesture,misinformation,eyewitness",,,"Dr Chris Martin, Kirsty L.

E01BF-A5E-D2A,Antisocial and Prosocial Behaviors as Predictors of Subsequent Substance Use in Adolescence,"Background. Antisocial behavior is a known risk factor for substance use in adolescence, but the combined effects of antisocial and prosocial behaviors are unknown. This study examined whether five types of anti- and prosocial behaviors are associated with subsequent alcohol and substance use. Methods. A prospective longitudinal cohort study of 3817 adolescents (55.3% females) aged 15 at baseline (T1) and 17 at follow-up (T2). Self-reports at T1 measured antisocial behaviors (criminal behavior, conduct problems) and prosocial behaviors (global prosociality, general trust, institutional trust). T2 measures included alcohol use (hazardous use, alcohol use disorder), drug use, and nicotine use. Results. Antisocial behaviors positively predicted all types of substance use (X2 = 5.79 to 59.07, p &lt; .001), while prosocial behaviors negatively predicted most substance use measures (X2 = -5.64 to 86.14, p = .862 to &lt; .001). After adjusting for covariance between antisociality and prosociality, it was found that conduct problems (X2 = 5.54 to 32.22, p = .005 to &lt; .001), criminal behavior (X2 = 3.61 to 33.77, p = .007 to &lt; .001), and institutional trust (X2 = -3.92 to 27.56, p = .262 to &lt; .001), were the most important predictors. Conclusions. Antisocial behaviors and deficits in institutional trust at age 15 are strong and unique predictors of substance use and alcohol use disorder by age 17. This specific spectrum of social behaviors during the critical phase of adolescence is of relevance from a prevention perspective to minimize the risk of later development of substance abuse.",2025-02-11T14:09:45.129587+00:00,"substance use,antisocial,alcohol use disorder,longitudinal,prosocial,adolescence",,,"Yasmina Molero Samuelson, Jonas Raninen, Simon Jangard, Nitya Jayaram-Lindström, Andreas Olsson",psyarxiv
E01CE-DA4-5C2,Resilience in Sexual Assault Victimization: Do Mindfulness and Emotion Regulation Buffer Associations with Post-traumatic Stress?,"Objective: The present study aimed to compare post-traumatic stress symptom (PTSS) severity for three victimization profiles: childhood sexual abuse (CSA)-only, adulthood sexual assault (ASA)-only, and CSA + ASA. Additionally, the study examined the role that resilience variables–mindfulness and emotion regulation–play in the association between victimization timing and PTSS severity. Method: Participants were 247 cisgender community women aged 21-30 recruited for a larger study on high-risk drinking and sexual behaviors. Victimization history was assessed using the Computer Assisted Maltreatment Inventory and Sexual Experiences Survey-Revised. PTSS severity was measured with the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5. Emotion regulation and mindfulness were evaluated using the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale-36 and Southampton Mindfulness Questionnaire, respectively. Negative binomial regression models tested the hypotheses. Results: Analyses revealed significant differences in PTSS severity by victimization timing: CSA + ASA was associated with the greatest PTSS severity, followed by ASA-only, and CSA-only reporting the lowest severity. Mindfulness and emotion regulation were directly associated with reduced PTSS severity across all victimization profiles. Conclusions: Revictimization was linked to the most severe PTSS, underscoring the need for targeted interventions. Mindfulness and emotion regulation were associated with reduced PTSS severity, regardless of victimization timing. Future interventions could prioritize enhancing psychological skills, like mindfulness and emotion regulation, to reduce distress for victim-survivors of sexual victimization.",2025-02-19T00:19:32.912993+00:00,"emotion regulation,sexual victimization,resilience,post-traumatic stress,mindfulness",,,"Sharon S.

E00D8-875-85C,User-Centered Development of Internet- and Mobile-Based Interventions for Sexual Dysfunction and Well-Being: Insights from a Qualitative Study,"Background. Sexual dysfunctions and well-being are critical areas of mental health that remain under-addressed in traditional psychotherapeutic settings. From a patient’s view, reasons include feelings of discomfort and fear of stigma. Internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMIs) may offer a way to reach this population and provide necessary support. Thus far, few studies investigated IMIs for sexual dysfunctions, mostly targeting specific disorders, like erectile dysfunction or vaginismus. This study aimed to identify the key requirements for developing an IMI for a broader range of sexual dysfunctions and sexual well-being from the perspective of potential users. Method. To gather insights into user needs and preferences, we conducted 13 semi-structured interviews with adult participants in Germany that reported to have sexual problems. Interviews were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Categories were established deductively-inductively from transcribed interview records based on a rigorous coding method. Results. Key findings revealed that expert knowledge and destigmatization are crucial components for a potential IMI for sexual dysfunctions and well-being. Preferred content topics included communication, dealing with sexualized violence, and sexual preferences. The design should prioritize clarity, customizability, and neutrality. While most participants were open to using a potential IMI with their partners and preferred on-demand professional support, the study also highlighted the importance of avoiding insensitivity and inappropriate content related to sexual abuse. Conclusions. This study underlines the importance of developing an IMI targeting sexual problems that is inclusive, responsive to diverse user needs, and adaptable to various psychotherapeutic contexts.",2024-12-11T18:53:23.174909+00:00,,,,"Lara Sikorski, Sarah Dahlhues, Salome Becker, Carlotta Schumann, Charlotte Riemann, Carmen Schaeuffele, Luisa-Felicitas Esch, Alexa Krugel, Alexandra Karg, Katharina Fröhlich, Virginia Merico, Friederike Fenski, Luza Schleinecke, Lisa Wilm, Annika Haedrich",psyarxiv
E000B-914-372,"The Role of Childhood Trauma, PTSD Symptoms and Pain Coping Strategies in Individuals with Chronic and Acute Pain: A Strength-Based Approach","Purpose: While links between chronic pain and childhood trauma or PTSD symptoms are well-established, the mechanisms behind these associations are not fully understood. This study examines how childhood trauma, PTSD symptoms, and pain coping strategies interact in individuals with chronic versus acute pain.
Methods: A total of 159 participants (chronic and acute pain groups) completed an online survey assessing childhood trauma pain coping strategies and current PTSD symptoms. Correlations between variables within each group, and differences between chronic and acute pain groups were evaluated using z-tests. 
Results: Pain intensity was positively associated with childhood trauma, particularly emotional (r = .32) and physical abuse (r = .24). PTSD symptoms, specifically re-experiencing (r = .29) and hyperarousal (r = .28) were also linked to greater pain intensity. Adaptive coping strategies like distraction and coping self-statements were negatively associated with pain intensity. These strategies showed stronger negative correlations with childhood trauma and PTSD symptoms in the chronic pain group (z = -2.57 to z = 5.43), suggesting more complex coping dynamics. Associations between trauma, PTSD symptoms, and pain were more pronounced in chronic pain sufferers.
Conclusions: These results have important clinical implications, emphasising the need for trauma-informed care in pain management interventions. Further research should explore effective strategies for managing the intersection of pain and trauma, particularly in chronic pain populations.",2025-06-23,,,,"Jayne Morriss, Lyn Ellett, Norma Rosenek",psyarxiv
E0141-43F-F7B,Therapeutic dissociation: From non-ordinary states to psychological transformation,"Common mental health pathologies such as depression, anxiety, addiction, and PTSD have recently seen treatment inroads. These issues share a phenomenological core—a dissociative quality that involves the disintegration of self and other. Interestingly, some of the most effective treatments of these pathologies are themselves acutely dissociative. For example, psychedelic therapy has been effective at treating these pathologies and involves highly dissociative altered states. This pattern holds across other dissociative methods such as hypnosis, CBT, and meditation, leading some to hypothesize that there is a common pathway from acutely altered states to long-term treatment of conditions that involve pathological dissociation. Among the proposed mechanisms are pivotal mental states, the entropic brain, REBUS, and pattern breaking. In this paper, I highlight the methods and mechanisms behind the observed clinical efficacy in treating pathologically dissociative mental health issues. I also propose a simplified underlying structure and an experimental approach that could result in effective treatment without complicated pharmacological interventions.",2024-01-12T19:02:38.170251+00:00,"logotherapy,ptsd,self,dissociation,meditation,entoptic phenomena,cognitive behavioral therapy,altered states,trauma,meaning,cbt,entropy,psychedelics,substance abuse,consciousness,anxiety,vr,addiction,therapy,complexity,depression,hypnosis,ocd,form constant",,,Joshua Clingo,psyarxiv
E0008-7A6-1FC,"In Rape-Trauma PTSD, Patient Characteristics Indicate Which Trauma-Focused Treatment They are Most Likely to Complete","Objectives: Dropout rates for effective therapies for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can be high, especially in practice settings. Although clinicians have intuitions regarding what treatment patients may complete, there are few systematic data to drive those judgments. Methods: A multivariable model of dropout risk was constructed with randomized clinical trial data (n=160) comparing prolonged exposure (PE) and cognitive processing therapy (CPT) for rape-induced PTSD. A two-step bootstrapped variable selection algorithm was applied to identify moderators of dropout as a function of treatment condition. Employing identified moderators in a model, five-fold cross-validation yielded estimates of dropout probability for each patient in each condition. Dropout rates between patients who did and did not receive their model-indicated treatment were compared. Results: Despite equivalent dropout rates across treatments, patients assigned to their model-indicated treatment were significantly less likely to drop out relative to patients who did not (relative risk = 0.49 [95% CI: 0.29 to 0.82]). Moderators included in the model were: childhood physical abuse, current relationship conflict, anger, and being a racial minority, all of which were associated with higher likelihood of dropout in PE than CPT. Conclusions: Individual differences among patients affect the likelihood they will complete a particular treatment, and clinicians can consider these moderators in treatment planning. In the future, treatment selection models could be used to increase the percentage of patients who will receive a full course of treatment, but replication and extension of such models, and consideration of how best to integrate them into routine practice, are needed.",2017-12-13T20:28:03.422791+00:00,"cognitive processing therapy,precision medicine,dropout,treatment selection,ptsd,prolonged exposure",,,"Patricia Resick, Brian Neil Smith, Shannon Wiltsey Stirman, Zachary Daniel Cohen, John R Keefe, Robert J DeRubeis",psyarxiv
E0229-1DE-719,"A brief new measure of trauma, relationship security, and affect across the lifespan: Development and initial validation of the Lifespan Negative Experiences Scale (LiNES)","Background. Negative experiences across the lifespan – particularly interpersonal trauma (e.g., abuse/neglect), negative affective states (e.g., feeling afraid or anxious), and relationship insecurity (e.g., not feeling secure) have been associated with a range of adverse physical and mental health outcomes in adulthood. However, negative previous life experiences are not always assessed when people present to services, particularly physical health services, and there are problems with existing measures, which are long and intrusive, and only ask about either current or childhood experiences without capturing other factors likely to affect resilience. Methods. Based on existing research, items were generated for a new measure called the Lifespan Negative Experiences Scale (LiNES), which was designed to retrospectively assess experiences of interpersonal trauma, relationship security, and affect at three developmental stages – childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. Principal components analysis and regression were used to refine and validate the LiNES using data from a non-clinical sample. Results. The final version of the LiNES contains 13 items, optionally used to ask about three developmental stages. It was found to be reliable and valid. In addition, LiNES scores at each developmental stage significantly predicted both physical symptom reporting and emotional processing difficulties in adulthood. Conclusions. The LiNES is a brief new measure of negative life experiences capable of retrospectively capturing data from three developmental stages. This study provides an initial indication, based on non-clinical data, that the LiNES could be relevant in a range of settings, including physical and mental health settings, and for future research applications.",2018-08-31T18:49:52.359850+00:00,"medically unexplained symptoms,attachment,affect,trauma,alexithymia,development",,,"Liat Levita, Glenn Waller, Markus Reuber, Emily Mayberry",psyarxiv
E00EC-966-3EE,Distinguishing prisoners who think about suicide from those who attempt suicide,"Background. Many people who consider suicide do not translate these intentions into action. Although prisoners constitute a particularly high-risk group for suicide, little is known about the factors that distinguish those who think about suicide from those who attempt suicide. Methods. Participants were 1326 adult offenders (1203 men) randomly selected from 15 Belgian prisons, representing 14% of the national prison population. Guided by an ideation-to-action framework, multivariate regression analysis compared prisoners who attempted suicide (n = 277) with those who thought about suicide but never made an attempt (n = 312) on a range of established risk factors. Results. Among the 589 prisoners reporting a lifetime history of suicidal ideation (44% of the total sample), almost half (47%) had made a suicide attempt. Relative to those who only thought about suicide, participants who attempted suicide were more likely to be violent offenders (aOR = 2.33, 95% CI 1.49–3.62) and have a history of non-suicidal self-injury (aOR = 3.19, 95% CI 2.09–4.86). The presence of self-reported mental disorder diagnosis (aOR = 2.84, 95% CI 1.91–4.24) and illicit substance abuse (aOR = 2.01, 95% CI 1.24–3.28) also independently differentiated prisoners who attempted v. considered suicide. Conclusion. This study provides preliminary evidence that behavioural and mental health factors are implicated in the transition from thoughts to acts of suicide in prisoners. Prospective studies are warranted to explore whether these risk factors predict progression from ideation to action over time.",2019-09-02T12:05:00.015405+00:00,"prison,suicidal ideation,suicide attempt,self-harm,ideation-to-action",,,"Louis Favril, Rory O' Connor",psyarxiv
E008D-84A-D73,Improving mental health and wellbeing among sexual and gender minorities using digital interventions: a systematic review,"Background: High burden of mental disorders among sexual minorities including lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender population is well documented. Digital platforms are increasingly being used by sexual minorities to communicate with each other, but there is no systematic review of digital interventions that can improve mental health among sexual minorities. This systematic review identified and evaluated the digital interventions for mental health among different sexual minorities. Methodology: We searched literature from six major databases and included studies published in the English language, describing interventions that have a component to improve mental health among any of the sexual minorities delivered through any of the digital platforms, and reporting mental health outcomes. Results: Among 1936 citations, only 11 studies fulfilled our criteria. In those studies, most (n=9) interventions were implemented in the U.S. The interventions included varying components including on increasing acceptance and affirmation, increase social support and health education, cognitive behavioral therapy to manage stress, depression, anxiety and other mental health conditions. Only 6 studies had randomized control design. Most of the studies reported reduction in bi/homonegativity and increased affirmation, decreased smoking and substance abuse, improved coping skills, reduced level of depression, anxiety, and stress among participants in the intervention groups. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review that evaluated digital intervention for mental health among sexual and gender minorities. Despite a low number of studies and heterogeneity across studies, the findings suggest potential improvements in mental health among sexual and gender minorities using digital interventions.",2020-02-05T04:51:21.783225+00:00,"gender minorities,mental health,telemedicine,ehealth,sexual minorities,lgbtq+,systematic review,mhealth,evidence-based mental health,psychological wellbeing",,,"Md Mahbub Hossain, Nusrat Fahmida Trisha, Abida Sultana, Samia Tasnim, Nishat Tasnim Hasan, Shayla Haque Mishu, Qiping Fan",psyarxiv
E01B5-DCA-8E1,Prevalence and severity of posttraumatic stress symptoms in psychosis: associations with affective and patient-centered variables in those referred for psychological services,"Individuals with psychosis and comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder typically present with more severe forms of illness. Subthreshold posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) are also likely to cause significant distress. The spontaneous disclosure of abuse history is unlikely, which is problematic given that PTSS often go unnoticed due to psychotic symptom overlap, yet when asked, most individuals desire treatment even for subthreshold PTSS. if associations are found between PTSS severity, clinical symptomology, and patient-centered variables, it will further justify the need to enhance PTSS screening during routine care to encourage appropriate referral to specialized services. One hundred and two individuals with psychosis participated in an intake evaluation following referral for psychological services at a clinic specializing in psychological interventions for psychosis, which included the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5. Prevalence of trauma exposure was explored in conjunction with PTSS severity and referral-type. Clinical variables were entered in a multivariate analysis of variance with low, moderate, and high PTSS severity. Of the 102 participants, 21.6% did not report trauma and 14.7% reported events not meeting DSM-5 PTSD criterion A. Data from 65 participants were included; 6.2% of which were referred for trauma. Main effects emerged for all variables except wellbeing and delusional severity. Depression, anxiety, and stress were all significantly higher in the severe compared to low PTSS categories. Quality of life was significantly lower in the severe versus low PTSS category. Severe PTSS were associated with depression, anxiety, and stress, and lower QoL. A severe PTSS category captures a broader range of people likely requiring services and speaks to an important need to improve referral rate for trauma intervention.",2020-09-08T18:45:02.052303+00:00,"trauma,schizophrenia,psychosis,psychotherapy,screening,patient-centered,posttraumatic stress symptoms,affect",,,"Danielle Penney, Martin Lepage, Ghassan El-Baalbaki",psyarxiv
E00CE-2B8-538,”I always ask all the necessary questions anyway“: Swedish police interviewers’ experiences when questioning uncooperative suspects,"Purpose. Research-based interviewing techniques for detecting deceit typically rely upon suspects being, at least partially, responsive and engaged in the conversation. To date, the scientific literature is more limited regarding situations where the suspect remains silent or speaks very little. The present study aimed to examine Swedish police officers’ self-reported strategies when interviewing uncooperative suspects. Methods. A total of 289 police officers responded to a national survey that included questions about handling silence. The participants worked with a wide range of criminal cases, including financial crimes, fraud, violent offences, domestic abuse, volume crime, and traffic violations. We used content analysis to examine their written responses to the open-ended question: “What, if any, strategies do you use when interviewing suspects who speak very little or not at all?”. Results. Four main categories were identified relating to (1) question strategies (e.g., asking the questions anyway, using silence), (2) information strategies (e.g., emphasizing the benefits of cooperating, informing about their legal right to silence), (3) supportive strategies (e.g., being friendly, asking about reasons for silence), and (4) procedural strategies (e.g., changing interviewers, conducting multiple interviews). Practitioners working with violent crimes reported meeting uncooperative suspects more frequently compared to practitioners working with other criminal offences. Conclusions. The results provide an initial exploration into the various strategies used by police interviewers when questioning uncooperative suspects. Gaining a better understanding about the underlying reasons behind silence in different criminal contexts may facilitate the development of effective strategies for overcoming resistance.",2021-08-13T13:39:51.457366+00:00,"law enforcement,investigative interview,survey,interrogation,suspect,sweden,police interview",,,"Mikaela Magnusson, Timothy J.

E0215-0AC-D72,The impact and perceived effectiveness of physical punishment: A qualitative study of young adults’ retrospective accounts,"Background: Physical discipline is a widely-studied parenting practice given its association with numerous negative outcomes, such as increased aggression and poor parent-child relationships. While research on this topic has been steadily growing, most studies have utilised quantitative data obtained from parents’ perspectives on the topic. As such, less is known about the heterogeneous experiences of children who had received physical punishment which may be better represented in qualitative feedback. Objective: This study aims to retrospectively explore the experience of having been physically disciplined from first-hand accounts. Participants: 25 young adults aged 18 to 24 (M = 21.4; female = 14) who had received physical discipline by their parents in the past were interviewed about their experiences over a video call. Methods: Interviews were conducted to explore participants’ experiences of parental discipline (physical and non-physical). Thematic analysis was conducted where the interviews were transcribed and coded, before being examined for concepts underlying the codes (“themes”). Results: Based on participants’ interviews, four themes were identified in relation to their experiences of physical punishment: 1) Unclear distinctions between physical discipline and abuse; 2) Negative consequences and the ineffectiveness of physical discipline; 3) Rationalising past experiences of physical discipline; 4) Negative past experiences of physical discipline does not preclude future use. Conclusions: The use of qualitative data provided rich insights into the nuances of receiving physical punishment. The four themes identified in this study were discussed in relation to existing literature. Implications of physical punishment on children’s mental health, as well as the importance of advocacy and legislation around physical punishment were highlighted.",2023-02-18T15:31:01.533727+00:00,"discipline,thematic analysis,physical punishment,intergenerational,qualitative",,,"Elinor Lim, Hoi Shan Cheung, Clarissa Choo, Kelly Ming Yue Chan, Charlene S.

E01FF-A26-903,Transcending the Self to Transcend Suffering,"Suffering is inevitable in human life. Our perspective paper theorizes on precise mechanisms for how self-transcendence––the state in which an individual looks beyond the self and adopts a larger perspective including concern for others and the world––may help people endure the experience of suffering. From an examination of empirical literature ranging from social psychology to clinical research, we propose that self-transcendence may aid the endurance of suffering along three psychological levels: (1) On the level of affect, the unique profundity and positivity of self-transcendent experiences (e.g., awe, flow, compassion) may supersede and reduce the salience of negative affect arising from suffering (e.g., fear, despair, depressive mood). (2) On the level of cognition, the larger frame of reference provided by self-transcendent thinking may contextualize one’s suffering as something comprehendible, thereby helping to resolve the challenges of making meaning from suffering (e.g., that one’s existing meaning systems are unable to explain the suffering event). (3) On the level of motivation, the drive to fulfill one’s need for self-transcendence may counterbalance the more hedonically-oriented motivations that can promote negative coping strategies in response to suffering (e.g., avoidance, substance abuse). All three mechanisms may also provoke downstream prosocial behaviors that help embed the individual into networks of social support. Altogether, by synthesizing specific mechanisms from affective, cognitive, and motivational self-transcendent processes, our paper establishes a theoretical framework for how self-transcendence may help people endure and transcend suffering, thereby elevating the conditions and experiences of our existence.",2023-03-15T16:49:48.160673+00:00,"self-transcendence,positive emotions,meaning in life,human existence,suffering,coping strategies",,,"Brian H.

E01C9-859-BF4,Bargaining and interdependence: common parent-offspring conflict resolution strategies among Chon Chuuk and their implications for suicidal behavior,"The anthropology of Pacific cultures spotlights social conflict as a key proximate cause of suicide. Ethnographic accounts suggest that suicidal behaviors occupy an extreme end of a spectrum of conflict-resolution strategies. We systematically investigate parent-child conflicts and the strategies adolescent and young adult children use to resolve these conflicts. We use concepts from human behavioral ecology to interpret results from in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 58 Chon Chuuk informants about conflicts with their parents during adolescence and young adulthood. One strategy for resolving conflicts in one’s favor is to impose costs through the threat or use of violence, but an alternative strategy for those who lack social power or formidability involves social withdrawal, or withholding cooperation, until the interdependent parties agree to more favorable terms. The Chuukese term amwunumwun refers to a spectrum of behaviors characterized by withdrawal that includes avoidance, running away, and suicide threats and attempts that can be used by Chon Chuuk youth in conflicts with parents and elder kinsmen. We found that strategies involving withholding cooperation were the most commonly reported child behavioral response. As predicted, low-cost strategies, such as negotiation, were associated with non-severe conflicts (e.g., playing with friends and doing homework), whereas high-cost forms of withholding cooperation, such as running away, were associated with severe conflicts (e.g., abuse and labor exploitation). Importantly, withholding cooperation was often, but not always, successful in resolving outcomes in the child’s favor. We propose that withholding cooperation is a culturally ubiquitous strategy that encompasses a spectrum of behaviors ranging from avoidance to suicidality used by the powerless to achieve favorable outcomes in conflicts with powerful individuals with whom they are interdependent.",2022-09-16T16:31:53.214749+00:00,"adolescence,suicide,parent-offspring conflict,power",,,"Kristen Syme, Edward Hagen",psyarxiv

Method: Participants were randomly assigned to receive standard PCIT (n = 120) or services-as-usual (SAU; n = 84). The sample was characterized by low household income and significant exposures to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and substance abuse. Intention-to-treat analyses were conducted on multiply-imputed data followed by secondary per-protocol analyses. Results: Significant PCIT effects emerged on (a) increased positive parenting and reduced negative parenting (small-to-medium ITT effects and medium-to-large per-protocol effects); (b) gains in inhibitory control performance on the stop-signal task (small-to-medium ES); (c) gains in parent-reported emotion regulation and (d) positive, affirming self-perceptions (small-to-medium ES), relative to SAU control. The effects of PCIT on gains in parent emotion regulation were mediated by reductions in observed negative parenting. No main effects were observed on parent RSA scores or child attributions. Harsh child attributions moderated treatment response: PCIT parents who held the harshest child attributions displayed the greatest gains in labelled praises and declines in negative talk/criticism. Conclusions: This randomized trial presents the first evidence that PCIT improves inhibitory control and emotion regulation in child welfare-involved parents and provides independent replication of other published trials documenting gains in observed parenting.",2021-10-28T23:20:30.069315+00:00,"inhibitory control,pcit,child welfare,emotion regulation,behavioral parenting interventions,parenting",,,"Elizabeth Skowron, Elliot Berkman, Kate Mills, Amanda Skoranski, Carrie Scholtes, Beverly W.

E00C8-D7B-406,More than just Treats? Effects of Grandparental Support for Children Growing up in Adversity,"This study examined whether grandparental support is a protective factor for children’s socio-emotional development in the context of adversity. Using longitudinal data from the Millennium Cohort Study, we investigated effects of grandparental support across development in children with and without childhood adverse experiences (ACEs). Socio-emotional development was assessed with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire when children were aged 3 years (N =10,185), 5 years (N =10,412), and 7 years (N =10,551). Grandparental childcare, coresidence and financial help was assessed and parents reported on the occurrence of five ACEs: physical and emotional abuse assessed with the Straus’ Conflict Tactics Scale, parental mental illness assessed with the Kessler scale, domestic violence, and parental separation. We found that children with high levels of ACEs showed more prosocial behaviour and less externalizing problems when they received grandparental care compared to non-grandparental (in)formal care, but only at age 3. By age 7, children with high levels of ACEs receiving grandparental care showed less prosocial behaviour and more externalizing problems. In addition, grandparental financial support at age 3 was related to more externalizing problems. Post-hoc analyses showed that internalizing and externalizing behaviours at age 5 were related to increased probability of grandparental childcare at age 7, indicating that children’s socio-emotional problems trigger grandparental support. Our findings point to a protective effect of grandparental care on children’s socio-emotional development at age 3 and results highlight the importance of going beyond the nuclear family toward the impact of the wider family network when examining children's socioemotional development.",2023-06-12T11:58:57.613154+00:00,,,,"Madelon Riem, Constantina Psillou, Anna Pearce, Anne-Laura Van Harmelen, Helen Minnis, Maaike Cima, Fred Hasselman",psyarxiv
E01E5-B9A-D81,Adverse childhood experience chronicity and timing: a study of UK Black and minority ethnic parents,"Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are a range of traumatic events, primarily including personal abuse, neglect, and household dysfunction, which frequently are associated with maladaptive consequences into adulthood. As such, ACEs also have the potential to adversely affect an individual’s response to their own children once they become a parent. While members of minority ethnic groups are at a higher risk of experiencing ACEs, research on how this affects parenting outcomes is limited. This study examines ACE exposure in a cohort of N=64 Black and minority ethnic parents in the UK. We found that ACEs were positively associated with parents self-reported harsh parenting, and negatively associated with nurturing parenting. Examining ACE timing, exposure during middle childhood, but not early or late childhood or adolescence, was predictive of both harsh and nurturing parenting. Examining the differential impact of ACE chronicity (i.e., prolonged exposure) and ACE frequency (i.e., number of ACEs), harsh parenting was significantly predicted by ACE chronicity, whereas nurturing parenting was predicted by ACE frequency. Mediation analyses showed a partial mediation of parental education for the link between ACE frequency and harsh and nurturing parenting outcomes. Our results contribute to a growing body of research highlighting the intricate interplay between early life adversity and parenting behaviours within minority ethnic communities. Findings underscore the need for targeted interventions and support systems aimed at breaking the cycle of ACEs, promoting healthier parenting practices, and ultimately fostering improved outcomes for both parents and their children in these communities.

Yet little is known about the volume and nature of these risks, including how different adversities or risks relate to one another. This exploratory study aims to bridge this gap, examining rates at entry to services and profiles of risk using a latent class analysis. Methods: Data were extracted for CYP who received at least one risk assessment at CAMHs in South London between January 2007 and December 2017. In total, there were 21,688 risk assessments. Latent class analysis was used to identify profiles of risk from the risk assessments. Results: Concerns about parent mental health (n=5,274; 24%), emotional abuse (n= 4,487; 21%), violence towards others (n= 4210; 19%), destructive behaviour (n=4,005; 18%), and not attending school (n=3,762; 17%) were the most commonly identified risks. Six distinct profiles of risk were identified from the latent class analyses: 1) maltreatment and externalising behaviours, 2) maltreatment but low risk to self and others, 3) antisocial behaviour, 3) inadequate caregiver supervision and risk to self and others, 5) risk to self but not others, and 6) mental health needs but low risk. Conclusions: These findings provide fresh insights into adverse experiences and risks identified by CAMHS. For professionals, the profiles identified in this study might provide insights into profiles of identified risks, in contrast to traditional cumulative approaches to risk. For researchers, these profiles may be fertile ground for hypothesis-driven work on the association between adversity and later outcomes.",2023-11-08T13:32:24.667172+00:00,"mental health,risk,safeguarding,camhs,adversity",,,"Francesca Crozier-Roche, David Graham, Keith Clements, Taliah Drayak, Paul Bywaters, Rick Hood, Ella Denford, Jack Smith, Amy Hillier, Andy Bilson, Teresa Geraghty, Ava Berry, Dustin Hutchinson, Matt Woolgar, Robbie Duschinsky, Barry Coughlan",psyarxiv
E010F-81C-86E,Adaptive suppression of motivational biases increases with mood/anxiety traits,"Background: Changes in motivational biases appear at the heart of many psychiatric disorders. Alterations in motivational biases, in the form of invigorated responding when promised rewards, and holding back when threatened with punishment, have been observed in many psychiatric conditions including depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. However, the specificity of these changes remains unclear. Here, we relate the (in)ability to suppress (maladaptive) motivational biases, to continuous, dimensional measures of psychiatric symptom levels in a sample from the general population focusing on mood-anxiety and impulsive-compulsive symptoms. Methods: We recruited an online sample from the general population (n = 500) through Prolific Academic, that performed a motivational Go/NoGo task, a cognitive test and a clinical questionnaire battery. We used factor analysis, mixed-effects regressions and computational modelling to link transdiagnostic symptom dimensions to the ability to adaptively suppress motivational biases. Results: We observed a double dissociation. Higher anxious-depressed symptoms predicted more suppression of motivational biases on trials on which these were incongruent with instrumental demands, resulting in better overall performance. Using a novel computational model, we show that this behaviour might arise from enhanced learning to flexibly suppress the impact of motivational biases. In contrast, higher compulsive symptom scores were associated with overall worse performance, likely reflecting a more general performance deficit. Discussion: We speculate that anxious-depressed individuals, showing heightened rumination and anxiety, might recruit excessive cognitive effort for suppressing motivational biases. This more ‘controlled’ mode of decision-making might lead to improved performance in tasks such as this one, but on the other hand exhaust participants and contribute to their symptoms.",2025-02-11T20:28:26.473329+00:00,"reinforcement learning,mood anxiety,computational modelling,pavlovian bias,decision making",,,"Mojtaba Rostami Kandroodi, Hanneke den Ouden, Vanessa Scholz, Johannes Algermissen, Claire Gillan",psyarxiv
E0165-A37-B36,Perceived Stigma and its Impact on Substance Use Disorder and Mental Health,"Perceived stigma (the perception of public attitudes towards members of a marginalized group) toward people who use substances hinders treatment seeking, impacts the quality of care received, and affects treatment success. Despite its relevance to treatment, research on stigma’s association with SUD-related outcomes is limited. This study aims to examine the associations between perceived stigma, types of substances used, mental health, and treatment type in a large sample across treatment sites. The present study involved survey completion upon treatment intake and early in treatment. Participants were individuals receiving treatment for substance use disorder (SUD; N=7591) in 75 treatment centers across the United States. Participants responded to the Perceived Stigma of Substance Abuse Scale (PSSAS). Participants’ primary substances were collected. Participants completed mental health (anxiety, depression, stress), quality of life, and substance use-related surveys (craving and pursuit of abstinence). Finally, the treatment type received by each patient was reported. Reporting primarily using alcohol predicted lower PSSAS scores, while primarily using benzodiazepines, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamines, and opioids predicted higher PSSAS scores. Higher PSSAS scores also predicted higher levels of anxiety, depression, stress, and craving and lower levels of quality of life and pursuit of abstinence. Receiving intensive outpatient treatment predicted lower PSSAS scores. SUD patients report different levels of stigma depending on the substance they use and the type of treatment they receive. The differences in stigma levels predict distinctions in mental health outcomes. These findings highlight the need for tailored stigma-reduction interventions for those receiving SUD treatment.

E00D8-05B-1C7,"Why and How Romantic Partners Make Each Other Feel Bad: A Dyadic Study of Goals, Strategies, and Outcomes of Extrinsic Emotion Regulation Over Three Weeks","Emotion regulation research has focused on how we improve our own emotions, with little research on how we improve others’ emotions and almost nothing on how or why we try to make others feel worse (extrinsic affect-worsening). The current study addresses this research gap by examining several regulation goals (worsen other’s affect, improve own affect, gain power), strategies (criticising, pressuring, withdrawing), and outcomes (positive affect, negative affect, perceived power) when opposite-sex romantic couples try to make each other feel worse. We aimed to examine: 1) which goals predict which strategies and 2) which strategies predict which outcomes. Participants (N = 167 dyads) completed six end-of-day surveys online over three consecutive weekends (n = 898 surveys). Within-person effects were analysed using longitudinal actor-partner interdependence models. Aim 1 results found mostly significant actor effects of goals on strategies. Effect sizes were largest for the goal ‘worsen other’s affect’.  Aim 2 hypotheses (that all strategies would worsen a partner’s affect) were not supported. In addition, no strategy predicted a decrease in a partner’s perceived power or increase in one’s own. This study is the first to examine extrinsic affect worsening with improve own affect goals, and with power as a regulation goal and outcome. This links intimate partner violence to emotion regulation theory, producing new insights. Future research could explore the antecedents and processes of affect-worsening to establish a more holistic understanding of extrinsic emotion regulation, and to inform interventions for abuse.",2025-04-16,"affect worsening,close relationships,emotion,emotion regulation",,,"Carolyn MacCann, Bernice Wu",psyarxiv
E00B9-E29-024,Traditional Masculinity Ideologies and Men’s Psychopathology: A Network Analysis,"Theoretical Background: Traditional masculinity ideologies (TMIs) comprise social beliefs about how men should be. Higher conformity to TMIs has been associated with increased psychopathology. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Network analysis, increasingly used in clinical psychology, visualizes psychopathology as a system of interconnected symptoms that co-occur through reciprocal reinforcement. Applying this method, we examined the associations between TMIs and psychopathology in men. Methods: An online survey of 517 cisgender men (Mage = 44.3 ± 15.3) from German- speaking Europe rated conformity to TMIs, depression, alcohol abuse, anxiety, anger and aggression, suicidality, and PTSD symptoms using validated self-report questionnaires. Participants were stratified into high TMI and low TMI groups by median split. Four networks were estimated: Models 1 and 2 compared high vs. low TMI groups while Models 3 and 4 examined the total sample, with TMIs as nodes in the psychopathology network. Results: Men with high conformity to TMIs exhibited elevated psychopathology. No significant differences in the psychopathology network structure were found between the TMI groups. Model 3 showed that TMIs were positively associated with anger and aggression, and externalizing depression symptoms. Model 4 showed that the TMI subdimensions risk-taking, violence, and winning were linked to increased anger and aggression. Self-reliance was associated with higher suicidality, whereas higher pursuit of status was correlated with lower suicidality. Greater risk-taking was associated with lower anxiety.
Conclusion: Incorporating TMIs into psychopathology networks highlights their role in reinforcing maladaptive symptom patterns. Conformity to TMIs should be considered when assessing and treating psychopathology in men.",2025-04-23,,,,"Andreas Walther, Michèle Schneeberger, Rudolf Debelak, Nikola Komlenac, Ulrike Ehlert",psyarxiv
E0199-1C1-D9B,‘Community Conversations’ to Understand Perceptions of Crime and Violence in a Low-Income Urban Setting,"Crime and violence are highly prevalent in South Africa, exacerbated by numerous socioeconomic challenges. To investigate how exposure to crime and violence (and their impacts, e.g. stress) are perceived in low-income communities, we hosted a set of facilitated ‘community conversations’, as opportunities for community engagement. Our objective was to provide a safe space for community members to share their perceptions; we were interested to know if such conversations would be feasible with adolescents (&gt;12 years) and adults in the community. We hosted five conversations (each 2.5-3 hours in length) with 25 adults (56% female) and 47 adolescents (26% female) at a local church, providing refreshments. Overall, it proved feasible to arrange and conduct ‘community conversations’ about stress and exposure to crime and violence in this community. Despite the sensitive nature of the topics being discussed, participants in all groups were found to be willing to speak openly and appeared to respond well to the term ‘stress’ rather than mental health. The main challenges identified in discussions were poverty, safety (linked to crime and violence), substance abuse, lack of trust, and conflict in homes, and a lack of unity within the community linked to a lack of trust. Poverty and unemployment were seen as contributing to these challenges, contributing to community members feeling unsafe and unprotected, and living with the fear of being targeted by crime and violence. Based on our experience of these conversations, we make recommendations relating to the feasibility, facilitation, and the role of such activities in research. Participants’ responses provided a positive indication that facilitating similar conversations on a more regular basis (and potentially in other communities) could help provide support for community members while also increasing researchers’ understanding of community member experiences.",2025-02-28T09:49:11.378165+00:00,,,,"Hleliwe Makaula, Kimberley D Lakes, Catherine Draper, Anna Blumenthal, Nonkululo Sikweyiya, Isabelle Blanchette, Caylee J Cook",psyarxiv
E0007-E7A-C48,Psychiatric conditions in today’s Russian leaders and ideologists: hypothesis,"Psychopathological approach to politics is successful if it identifies politicians or ideologists with a limited mental competence. An attempt is made here to analyze mental conditions of Vladimir Putin and the influential ideologist Aleksandr Dugin. Dmitry Medvedev and Ramzan Kadyrov are briefly discussed as well. Physical maltreatment was described in Putin’s biographies. It was hypothesized that he is re-enacting traumas in conditions of intergenerational traumatic chain. Child abuse is associated with various psychiatric and related conditions including paranoia. A paranoid call may sanction destruction of supposed enemies. Putin formulated the aims of his military operation: to protect Russian-speakers from “genocide”, to disarm and denazify Ukraine. Apparently, this idea is delusional. Certain war instigators are paranoid in their tendency to present themselves as prophets or world saviors. Some of them are aggressive against delusional goals. Mentally healthy people can be susceptible to psychotic appeals, a predisposing condition being fear of strangers and projection of hatred upon them. Some individuals, maltreated during their childhood, respond by acting out fight or flight responses, attacking weaker persons and submitting to dominant ones. This seems to be reflected by Putin’s relationships with Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of Chechen Republic, who appears as a dominant personality. Certain ethnically non-Russian subjects of the Federation may be interested in a continuation of the Ukraine war; and there are concerns that Putin has come under their influence. An important topic in this connection is the inter-ethnic difference in the birth rate and migrations, which is avoided by Russian media and officials these days. In conclusion, mental derangements in politicians are dangerous and must be diagnosed by psychiatrists on the basis of speech, writings, and behavior. More expert opinions are needed.",2024-12-09T09:01:37.398412+00:00,,,,Sergei V. Jargin,psyarxiv
E0033-E90-6DB,Everyday Smartphone Behaviors Predict Life Outcomes,"Smartphone sensing provides an objective lens into contextualized human behavior, enabling ecologically valid perspectives on human lives. In this study, we evaluate the predictive power of smartphone-tracked behaviors relative to self-reported Big Five personality traits, the current gold standard for life outcome prediction. Using Random Forests to model data from a quota-representative sample of the German population (n = 752), we predicted 42 life outcomes spanning individual, interpersonal, and societal domains. Smartphone-based models outperformed the Big Five traits for 10% of outcomes and achieved comparable performance for 50%, with median Spearman correlations of up to r = .34 between predicted and actual outcome values. Behavioral data were particularly effective for outcomes closely tied to observable cues, including compulsive smartphone usage, substance abuse, and socioeconomic status. In contrast, subjective outcomes such as well-being were better predicted by personality traits. Feature importance analyses show differences in the number and importance of features across behavioral categories. While the number of features per category was determined by study design, patterns emerged in their importance: app usage and notifications include many features with relatively high importance; keyboard usage includes many with lower average importance; and screen and Wi-Fi categories include fewer features with relatively high importance. Our findings highlight that smartphone-tracked behaviors can complement traditional psychological measures in predicting life outcomes. They also suggest promising applications for behavioral interventions, while underscoring the need to clarify causal relationships and ensure ethical, responsible use.",2025-05-15,,,,"Pietro Alessandro Aluffi, Clemens Stachl, Daniel Racek, Markus Bühner, Larissa Sust, Maximilian Bergmann, Timo Koch, Jan Digutsch, Ramona Schoedel",psyarxiv
E0036-336-30B,"Association of Comorbid Substance Use Disorders and PTSD on Later Symptom Severity, Functioning, and Economic Outcomes among Veterans Applying for Department of Veterans Affairs PTSD Disability Benefits: A Retrospective Cohort Study","Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that is comorbid with substance use disorders (SUDs) has been associated with poorer mental health outcomes compared to when SUD is not present. Objectives: To identify the prevalence of SUDs in Veterans who have applied for PTSD disability benefits and, within this subgroup, examine the effect of a SUD diagnosis on PTSD symptom severity, functioning, and economic outcomes approximately 2 years later. Method: Retrospective, gender-stratified cohort study of 4,918 representatively sampled Veterans who applied for Department of Veterans’ Affairs (VA) PTSD disability benefits between 1994 and 1998. We used medical administrative data to determine if a SUD diagnosis was present when Veterans’ disability claims were adjudicated. PTSD symptom severity; work, role, and social functioning; physical functioning; working for pay; and low income were assessed by mailed survey approximately 2 years later. Results: 3,337 (68%) Veterans returned surveys. Among respondents, men were more likely than women to have any SUD diagnosis at the time of their claims’ adjudication (25.6% v. 17.6%, p &lt; 0.001). Regardless of gender, Veterans with a SUD diagnosis had clinically meaningful and statistically significantly severer PTSD symptoms and poorer functioning approximately 2 years after their claim was adjudicated than did Veterans without SUD (ps &lt; 0.001). Work, role, and social functioning was also statistically significantly worse for men and women with a SUD diagnosis (ps &lt; 0.001). In terms of economic outcomes, men and women with a SUD diagnosis at the time their claim was adjudicated were 50-60% less likely to report working for pay two years later and 40%-100% more likely to report low income compared to respondents without a SUD diagnosis (ps &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Although a substantial fraction of respondents were diagnosed with a SUD at the time their claim was adjudicated, the proportion of men with a SUD was similar to that reported for other clinical samples with PTSD; it was actually lower among the women compared to other clinical samples. A SUD diagnosis was a poor prognostic factor for the Veterans in this sample, associated with severer PTSD, poorer functioning, and poorer economic outcomes.",2019-04-09T22:00:54.308931+00:00,"penn inventory for ptsd,functioning,drug dependence,social adjustment scale,disability benefits,veterans,ptsd,posttraumatic stress disorder,alcohol dependence,alcohol abuse,compensation,trajectory,gender differences,substance use disorders,disability,cohort,prognosis,employment,longitudinal",,,"Michel H Boudreaux, Maureen Murdoch",psyarxiv
E00CF-938-55E,"Exaggerated Misperceptions of Police, not Exaggerated Claims of Harmful Drug Effects on the Brain, is Killing Black People and Police: Reply to “Exaggerating Harmful Drug Effects on the Brain Is Killing Black People”","In a recent Neuron NeuroView article, Dr. Carl Hart raises concerns that drug research exaggerates detrimental effects on the brain, which contributes towards harmful stereotypes or toxicology reports being used to justify and legitimize police brutality and killing of black people. In Part 1, I review the cases that Hart mentions to support his central claim. I find they do not provide sufficient evidence that drugs play a systematic role in motivating, justifying or legitimizing police brutality or deadly force. Future studies of police-civilian interactions are required to prove or disprove the hypothesis. Hart uses the term ‘massacre’ to refer to police killings of black people, but offers little to no evidence that police are massacring black people. In Part 2, I review two large national officer-involved fatality databases and summarize studies of racial bias and policing. To date, there is very little to no systematic evidence for anti-black bias in police shootings or killings. In Part 3, I delineate a causal pathway and cite evidence to describe how widespread, distorted perceptions of police may paradoxically contribute towards hundreds of excess homicides and thousands of felonious crimes per year in the US. These violent crimes are committed against mostly black victims, thus exacerbating the cycles of violence and structural disadvantages of socioeconomically distressed minority communities. Hart also states recreational drugs have overwhelmingly positive effects and pose less danger than police, yet black people are ~400x more likely to die by drug overdose than by an unarmed encounter with police, which is comparable to the odds of being struck by lightning. Mass protests sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of police have raised awareness about police brutality and the need for police reform, but distorted perceptions of police, amplified by media bias and misinformation, have also led to mass rioting, looting, and the destruction of thousands of small businesses (many of which were black-owned). They have also fueled ambush revenge killings of more than 20 officers since 2014 and have increased officers’ concerns over their safety. I propose a systems level, causal network as an approach to model the public and mental health outcomes of high profile police brutality videos that includes complex interactions among psychosocial factors and the influences of misinformation and racial, media and political bias. The model may inform evidence-based strategies to ameliorate health inequities attributed to structural racism and suggests new avenues for research in these areas.",2020-10-27T07:38:39.851754+00:00,"racial bias,police use of force,systems psychology,evidence based advocacy,officer-involved shootings,racial disparity",,,Spiro P.

E01BF-8E8-0D7,A PRACT: A Pragmatic Randomized Adaptive Clinical Trial to Investigate Brief Interventions in the Emergency Department in Tanzania,"Background Alcohol abuse, especially in resource limited low income settings, comes with increased health and injury risks. Treatment in these settings lacks the specialized trained personnel and infrastructure. Implementing evidence based interventions from a high-income setting, like a Brief Intervention (BI) for alcohol administered to Emergency Department injury patients, will require fine tuning and adaptations to the setting, population and culture. As such, this study aims to rapidly optimize and evaluate the impact of a BI to control alcohol use and related harms. Methods/Design Our single-blinded adaptive randomized controlled trial is designed to determine the most efficacious BI intervention to reduce hazardous alcohol use among acute injury patients. Phase 1, in this ‘seamless phase 1 to phase 2’ adaptive trial, will determine if a BI with or without a SMS booster is more effective than a no-contact usual care. Without a change in study procedures and statistical efficiency, phase 2 will compare if a BI without or with a standard SMS booster is more effective. Finally, in Phase 3, we will compare the more effective arm in Phase 2 to a new BI with personalized SMS booster. The study will occur among acute injury patients who present to Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center referral hospital in Northern Tanzania who are 1) alcohol positive on arrival to the hospital, 2) have an Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test of 8 or above or 3) have admitted to drinking alcohol prior to suffering their injury. The intervention consists of a nurse administered brief motivational interviewing session with or without a standard or personalized SMS booster; the control group will be a no-contact group until the time of follow-up. The primary outcome for the study is mean weekly consumption and number of binge drinking events; the secondary outcomes for the study are a reduction of alcohol related consequences by the Drinker Inventory of Consequences.",2018-06-03T04:35:12.799976+00:00,,,,Joao Ricardo Nickenig Vissoci,psyarxiv
E008C-CE0-E34,Preprint: Using the Threat Probability Task to assess anxiety and fear during uncertain and certain threat,"Fear of certain threat and anxiety about uncertain threat are distinct emotions with unique behavioral, cognitive-attentional, and neuroanatomical components. Both fear and anxiety can be studied in the laboratory by measuring the potentiation of the startle reflex. The startle reflex is a defensive reflex that is potentiated when an organism is threatened and the need for defense is high. The startle reflex is assessed via electromyography (EMG) in the orbicularis oculi muscle elicited by brief, intense, bursts of acoustic white noise (i.e., “startle probes”). Startle potentiation is calculated as the increase in startle response magnitude during presentation of sets of visual threat cues that signal delivery of mild electric shock relative to sets of matched cues that signal the absence of shock (no-threat cues). In the Threat Probability Task, fear is measured via startle potentiation to high probability (100% cue-contingent shock; certain) threat cues whereas anxiety is measured via startle potentiation to low probability (20% cue-contingent shock; uncertain) threat cues. Measurement of startle potentiation during the Threat Probability Task provides an objective and easily implemented alternative to assessment of negative affect via self-report or other methods (e.g., neuroimaging) that may be inappropriate or impractical for some researchers. Startle potentiation has been studied rigorously in both animals (e.g., rodents, non-human primate) and humans which facilitates animal-to-human translational research. Startle potentiation during certain and uncertain threat provides an objective measure of negative affective and distinct emotional states (fear, anxiety) to use in research on psychopathology, substance use/abuse and broadly in affective science. As such, it has been used extensively by clinical scientists interested in psychopathology etiology and by affective scientists interested in individual differences in emotion.",2018-11-20T16:46:41.346416+00:00,"uncertainty,psychophysiology,startle,fear,shock,anxiety,translational,electromyography,humans,addiction",,,"Daniel E.

E006A-64D-C82,Identifying cognitive deficits in cocaine dependence using standard tests and machine learning,"Background and aims There is a growing need for detecting valid and generalizable markers due to a demand of accurate Cocaine Dependence diagnosis and treatment. Machine Learning (ML) is a modern statistical alternative to select from multiple observations the most reliable features, which allows precise and more effective categorization addressing the demand to improve diagnosis. The aim of the current study was to identify cognitive markers by using three ML algorithms, Elastic Net (GlmNet), Random forest (Rf) and Generalized Linear Model (Glm), with the purpose of classify Cocaine Dependence (CD) and Non-dependent controls (NDC) to make it generalizable for new samples. Methods Two independent samples were required, the first one consisted on 87 participants (53 CD and 34 NDC) and the second one conformed by 40 participants (20 CD and 20 NDC). All participants were evaluated with neuropsychological tests that included 40 variables assessing cognitive domains of flexibility, inhibition, working memory, problem solving, planning, decision making and theory of the mind. With the results of the cognitive evaluation the three ML algorithms were trained in the first sample and tested on the second one to classify into CD and NDC. Results Even though the three algorithms had a ROC performance over 50%, GlmNet was superior in both, training (ROC = 0.71) and testing set (ROC = 0.85) compared to Rf and Glm. Furthermore, GlmNet was capable of identifying eight predictors out of 40 from all the cognitive domains assessed. Conclusions ML is an effective approach for the identification of generalizable cognitive markers. Specific subsets resulted robust predictors for accurate classification of new cases, such as those from cognitive flexibility and inhibition domain. These findings are relevant in addictions field as they have highly beneficial potential for diagnosis and treatment improvement, not only for CD but also for other substances abuse.",2018-11-26T18:06:59.784330+00:00,"lasso,cognitive markers,elastic net regression,cocaine dependence,cognition,random forest,machine learning",,,"Jorge Gonzalez-Olvera, Ernesto Reyes-Zamorano, Diego Angeles-Valdez, Viviana Villicaña, Said Jiménez, ruth alcala, Eduardo A.

Objective: We aimed to examine extant literature on pandemics to identify the expected impact of COVID-19 on children’s psychosocial health and secondary outcomes, including nutritional, financial and child safety outcomes. Data Sources: Articles were searched within the Medline, Global Health, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases on June 11th, 2020. Gray literature was also examined from the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations International Fund (UNICEF) until July 24th, 2020. Study Selection: A total of 8332 articles were screened for eligibility by two independent reviewers. Of these, 7,919 and 413 articles were from academic databases and additional sources, respectively. Data Extraction: Results on child outcomes were extracted and collated. Results: Seventy-three articles met inclusion criteria. Children have faced significant challenges with 12% of total articles indicating loneliness/depression, 21% anxiety, 7% grief, 10% stress-related disorders, 25% child abuse, 8% family conflict, and 12% stigma during pandemics/epidemics. Furthermore, 25% of articles indicated economic challenges, 23% negative academic impacts, 33% improper nutrition, and 21% reduced opportunities for play/increased screen time. These challenges were exacerbated among children who were female, having a disability, or being a migrant/displaced child.

E0011-3F5-F7F,The impact of maternal care and blood glucose availability on the cortisol stress response in fasted women,"Both, early life adversity (ELA), like being exposed to physical or emotional abuse, or low maternal care, and blood glucose availability have been associated with regulatory alterations in the endocrine stress system: here, individuals with a history of ELA and fasting individuals with low blood glucose levels have been shown to exhibit a blunted cortisol response to acute stress. However, a possible interaction of both factors has not been investigated yet, despite well-documented metabolic dysregulations after ELA. Therefore, the current study examined the effects of maternal care and blood glucose concentration on the physiological stress response. After screening for eligibility, N=122 women (meanage=22.12, sdage=2.56) were assigned to either a low, medium or high ELA group based on the maternal care subscale of the Parental Bonding Instrument. After an overnight fast, participants of each group came to the laboratory in the morning and were randomly assigned to either consume grape juice (condition sugar), or water (condition water) prior to being exposed to the Trier Social Stress Test for groups. Salivary samples for cortisol and alpha amylase detection, blood glucose concentrations, and mood ratings were assessed repeatedly. The effects of maternal care and sugar load on cortisol, alpha amylase and blood glucose trajectories were examined using multilevel mixed models. While we could replicate previous results showing the effect of glucose levels on the cortisol stress response, we could neither observe a main effect of ELA on the cortisol stress response, nor an interaction. We did however find an effect of ELA on the amylase stress response. Results are discussed in the light of methodological challenges associated with this type of research, and the possible role of the interaction among the various stress / energy systems in the mediation of ELA effects.",2020-11-09T14:25:48.744123+00:00,"glucose,stress,cortisol,early life adversity",,,"Stephanie Dimitroff, Bernadette Denk, Maria Meier, Ulrike U.

E0213-34D-96E,The state of dispositional mindfulness research,"Objectives We present a bibliometric review of research on trait mindfulness published from 2003 till 2021 to determine the current state of the field and identify research trajectories. Methods A search conducted on Aug 25, 2021 using the search terms “trait mindfulness” OR “dispositional mindfulness” in the Web of Science Core Collection identified 1405 documents. Results Using keyword-based network analyses, the various clusters suggested two major approaches in the field, one focusing on cognitive attentional processes, and a second approach that encompasses a wider field of well-being and clinical research topics. We also document increasing consolidation of research fields over time, with research on wider individual differences such as personality being subsumed into clinically and wellbeing-oriented research topics. More recently, a distinct theme focused on the validity of measurement of mindfulness emerged. In addition to general patterns in the field, we examined the global distribution of trait mindfulness research. Research output was substantially skewed towards North American-based researchers with less international collaborations. Chinese researchers nevertheless also produced research at significant rates. Comparing the difference in research topics between China and the US-based researchers we found substantial differences with US research emphasizing meditation and substance abuse issues, whereas researchers from China focused on methodological questions and concerns around phone addiction. Conclusions Overall, our review indicates that research on trait mindfulness might profit from conceptual and cultural realignment, with greater focus on individual differences research in other areas of psychology to complement the strong clinical and cognitive focus we well as also stronger cross-cultural and comparative studies.

This study uses network analysis to bridge this gap. Methods: Networks were constructed to examine relationships between schizophrenia symptoms (Positive and Negative Symptom Scale; PANSS), bodily self-disturbances (Perceptual Aberration Scale; PAS), and self-reported exposure to childhood trauma (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, Short-Form; CTQ-SF) in 152 people with a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder. Shortest path and bridge analyses were conducted to assess the role of bodily self-disturbances in linking childhood trauma to schizophrenia symptomatology. Three networks were constructed: 1) PAS, childhood trauma, and PANSS sub-scale composites (positive, negative, general); 2) PAS, childhood trauma, and positive symptoms, 3) PAS, childhood trauma, and distress symptoms. Results: Shortest path analysis revealed that bodily self-disturbances were on the shortest path between childhood trauma and positive and general symptoms (network 1), between trauma and hallucinations (network 2), and between trauma and depression (network 3). Bodily self-disturbances were also found to serve as a bridge between childhood trauma and positive symptoms of schizophrenia, particularly delusions and hallucinations. Conclusions: Using a novel, data-driven approach, we showed that bodily self-disturbances play a key role in linking childhood trauma to positive and co-morbid affective symptoms of schizophrenia. Threat experiences (i.e., abuse) specifically relate to bodily self-disturbances and psychotic symptoms.",2023-07-04T00:04:33.313048+00:00,"childhood trauma,bodily self-disturbances,network analysis,schizophrenia",,,"Julia Sheffield, Stephan Heckers, Kristan Armstrong, Jinyuan Liu, Lénie Torregrossa",psyarxiv
E0177-A91-CA3,Self-treatment of depression and complex post-traumatic stress disorder with psilocybin and LSD—A retrospective case study,"In medicine, psychedelics were initially considered as a tool for clinicians to understand psychotic states. Based on the presented case data, a reversal of that concept is proposed: psychedelics could be conceptualized as a tool for people chronically anxious and depressed since early childhood to understand ordinary states of mind (e.g. calmness, hopefulness, relaxation, and joy). The case concerns a young man who suffered from early-onset complex trauma due to daily abuse by his comprehensive school teacher and other pupils, resulting in severe anxiety and depression. He refused anti-depressive medication. Supportive psychotherapy failed to alleviate the situation, and interaction with psychiatric personnel subjectively experienced as rejection escalated his symptoms. At the age of 19, he resorted to unsupervised self-treatment with psilocybin. Occasional high-dose psilocybin sessions alone did not produce permanent outcomes in a constantly retraumatizing environment. After becoming unemployed at the age of 25, he dedicated himself to working with psychedelics more intensively, with gradually declining doses. The essence of his method was to relive the originally overwhelming traumatic events, maintaining a conscious focus on somatic sensations and avoiding getting overwhelmed again. In his own estimation, by the age of 30, he had resolved most of his early trauma but had been sensitized to the prevalence of trauma and its consequences (e.g. violence, racism) in the society, and his exposure to these continued to cause him suffering. Regardless, he had gained 'a foundational feeling of peace or stability that could provide safety in the middle of all this'. The information for this case study was acquired in the course of semi-structured retrospective interviews 2.5 years apart. The case illustrates that chronic treatment-resistant depression together with an unsupportive social environment may present a challenge for psychedelic therapy. As with ketamine, chronic administration may be necessary in some cases.",2023-03-10T13:41:21.646323+00:00,"dissociation,psilocybin,mdma,bullying,muscimol,major depression,c-ptsd,psychedelics,dmt,psychedelic therapy,amanita muscaria,lsd,treatment-resistant depression",,,Mika Turkia,psyarxiv
E0079-A9A-A2F,The Co-occurrence of Social Adversities in Early Adolescence and Their Relationship to Cognitive Outcomes Later in Development,"Background: Adverse experiences – such as abuse and neglect – occurring during childhood and adolescence have been found to predict poorer mental and cognitive health. Social adversities, including bullying and social exclusion, are likely to be particularly salient during adolescence. However, our understanding of how social adversities co-occur in adolescence and how they predict cognitive functioning is limited. Methods: We used latent profile analysis to investigate adolescents' experiences of social adversities and regressions to identify their relationship to cognition later in development. Data was analysed from UKHLS (N = 493, aged 14 - 16 years, preregistered analysis) and ALSPAC (N = 14,856, aged 12 - 22 years, replication analysis). Results: Adolescents clustered into four profiles in both cohorts: low adversity, peer difficulties, sibling bullying and poly-adversity. We found that 17-22% of participants fell into the poly-adversity profile and reported experiencing several social adversities. In ALSPAC, but not UKHLS, cognitive functioning differed between social adversity profiles (working memory: F(3, 3773) = 8.07, p &lt; .001; fluid reasoning: F(3, 5258) = 3.36, p = .018; verbal fluency: F(3, 5261) = 6.24, p &lt; .001). After controlling for sex, adolescents in the low adversity profile scored significantly higher on the working memory task than those in the sibling bullying profile and the poly-adversity profile, but effect sizes were small. Conclusion: These findings have implications for understanding adolescents' social experiences. To understand individual differences in lifespan outcomes, it is essential to capture a broad spectrum of social interactions, including peer and sibling difficulties, bullying, exclusion, and school issues.

E017C-395-1DA,Associations of neighborhood threat and deprivation with psychopathology: Uncovering neural mechanisms,"Background
Dimensional models of adversity have primarily focused on proximal experiences (e.g., child abuse and neglect).  Adopting a more distal lens by assessing dimensions of neighborhood environments could help identify broader contextual features that influence psychopathology across the lifespan and mechanisms underlying these associations. The current study examines associations of dimensions of neighborhood environments with psychopathology symptoms along with potential emotion, cognitive, and neural mechanisms central to dimensional models of adversity.

Method
The ABCD sample included 11,868 participants aged 9-10 across 21 sites in the U.S. Associations were examined for neighborhood indicators of threat and deprivation with emotion processing (adaptation to emotional conflict, task-active ROIs for emotional n-back), cognition (EF and task-active ROIs for the stop-signal task), and neural function (rs-fc of amygdala to resting state network connectivity and within-network rs connectivity). Mixed effect models nesting within family and site assessed indirect effects for neighborhood and symptoms.

Results
Indirect effects of neighborhood deprivation across symptom domains through EF were observed. Neighborhood deprivation, but not threat, had an indirect effect on psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) through within-retrosplenial temporal and within-dorsal attention network connectivity. Indirect effects for only neighborhood threat were observed with attention difficulties/internalizing problems/PLEs, through default mode within-network connectivity, with PLEs through visual network within-network connectivity, and with PLEs/externalizing symptoms through amygdala to sensorimotor network connectivity. 

Conclusion
Results provide insights into neural and cognitive processes underlying observed links between different neighborhood components and psychopathology, with implications for prevention and intervention efforts at the individual and contextual level.",2025-02-15,,,,"Katie A.

E0186-2EE-870,Do opioid analgesics improve subjective well-being? A prospective observational study of acute opioid effects before surgery,"Exposure to opioid analgesics due to surgery increases the risk of new persistent opioid use. A mechanistic hypothesis for opioids’ abuse liability rests on the belief that in addition to pain relief, acute opioid treatment improves mood, e.g. via euphoria and anxiety relief. However, opioids do not consistently improve mood in laboratory studies of healthy non-opioid users. Here, we determined how two commonly used opioid analgesics affected patients’ subjective well-being in standard clinical practice. Day surgery patients rated their mood before and after open-label infusion of remifentanil (N=159) or oxycodone (N=110) on the operating table before general anesthesia. One minute after drug injection, patients reported feeling intoxicated (&gt;6/10 points). As hypothesized, anxiety was reduced after opioids; this anxiolytic effect was however modest (remifentanil Cohen’s d=0.21; oxycodone d=0.31). Unexpectedly, we found moderate to strong evidence against a concurrent improvement in positive affect (Bayes Factors &gt;6.5). After remifentanil, ratings of ‘feeling good’ were even significantly reduced from pre-drug ratings (d=0.28). After oxycodone, only 1 in 3 participants felt better than pre-drug. Ordered logistic regressions revealed a link between prior drug exposure and opioid mood effects: while opioid-naïve patients were unlikely to feel better (21%) after opioids, the odds were &gt;4 times higher given a history of prolonged opioid use (&gt;2 weeks, adjusted OR=4.4). In sum, these ecologically valid data suggest that mood improvement by opioids in opioid-naïve patients is infrequent. Nevertheless, perioperative exposure could mechanistically increase risk of persistent use by elevating the likelihood of positive mood improvement during post-operative opioid treatment.",2022-08-08T12:29:52.570215+00:00,"reward,oxycodone,mood,opioid liking,opioid,remifentanil,opioid use,relief,pain,euphoria,anxiousness",,,"Marie Eikemo, Eric Garland, Eira Nordeng Jensen, Isabell M.

E00D8-C5A-AF1,Unaccompanied migrant children in the United States: Implementation and effectiveness of Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy,"Objective: The number of unaccompanied children (UC) arriving in the United States (U.S.) from other countries has increased significantly over the past decade. UC report high trauma exposure and greater posttraumatic stress symptoms compared to youth who immigrate with caregivers. Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) has demonstrated preliminary effectiveness with UC. However, few studies have treated U.S.-based samples of UC, who emigrate primarily from Central America. Method: One hundred and thirty eight UC were referred for treatment and 129 completed a pre-treatment assessment including the Child and Adolescent Trauma Screen (CATS) and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Most UC were from Central America (n = 109; 79.0%) and resided in government facilities (n = 76; 55.1%). One hundred and twenty two youth began TF-CBT, had an average of 9.71 sessions (SD = 9.3, range: 1-48), and 41.8% (n = 51) completed treatment. One hundred and four youth completed a brief, 6-item progress monitoring measure of trauma symptoms, for which 84 had at least two observations during treatment. Results: UC endorsed 3.80 traumatic events on average (SD = 2.38). High rates of violence, physical and sexual abuse, and serious injury were reported. There were significant improvements on most self-report rating scales (p &lt; .05); within-subjects Cohen’s d’s ranged from .07 to 1.03 for pre to post-treatment assessments and was d = .44 for the progress monitoring measure. Therapists reported on TF-CBT modifications for UC, including discussing mental health beliefs, navigating roles and relationships, tailoring treatment examples, exploring coping strategies, and addressing immigration factors. Conclusion: Preliminary findings support the utility of TF-CBT with UC.

E0245-54E-2AD,Improving Mental Health on College Campuses: Perspectives of Indian College Students,"The mental health of college students is increasingly viewed as an important public health priority. However, there has been little attention paid specifically to college students’ perspectives on factors that contribute to mental health challenges or on potential initiatives that could address them. Even less research has focused on students in low-and middle-income countries. In an effort to better understand how to improve mental health and wellness on college campuses, we administered an open-ended survey to 141 Indian college students (Mage=19.47, 65% female). We asked the students to identify: a) issues that contribute to mental health problems among college students, b) potential initiatives or strategies that could be used to improve mental health and wellness, and c) topics that students would like to learn about in a course about mental health and wellness. Applying thematic analysis, we identified academic stressors (e.g., pressure to succeed, competitiveness) and social stressors (e.g., lack of community, party culture and substance abuse) that students reported as contributors to mental health problems. Students also described mental health promotion strategies that could be implemented by faculty members (e.g., providing academic accommodations for students with mental health concerns), the student body (e.g., establishing peer counseling groups), and individual students (e.g., checking-in with others). Finally, they identified topics that they would like to learn about in mental health and wellness courses (e.g., how to identify mental health concerns, how to support friends). By raising several potential targets for mental health and wellness interventions for Indian college students, our study illustrates how open-ended surveys can be a useful and feasible way to solicit input from stakeholders in low- and middle-income countries. Future research will be needed to assess the effectiveness and feasibility of mental health promotion strategies, including those proposed by students.",2021-09-23T22:22:13.529479+00:00,"global mental health,mental health promotion,college students,india,open-ended assessment",,,"Akash R.

E00C1-89A-0DB,"Co-development of alcohol use problems and antisocial peer affiliation from ages 11 to 34: Selection, socialization, and genetic and environmental influences","Background and aims: Social context is an important factor in determining the developmental trajectory of alcohol use. We examined the co-development between alcohol use problems and antisocial peer affiliation. We also estimated the genetic and environmental influences on alcohol use problems, antisocial peer affiliation, and their co-development over time. Design: Longitudinal study using bivariate latent basis models with structured residuals (LBM-SR). A biometric model was then fit to estimate the genetic and environmental influences on the growth factors and their covariances. Setting: The United States mid-west region. Participants: Members of the Minnesota Twin Family Study (MTFS), an ongoing, longitudinal study of 3762 (52% female) twins (1,881 pairs). Measurements: Alcohol use problems were assessed using a composite measure of average number of drinks per occasion in the past 12 months, maximum number of drinks in 24 hours, and DSM-III-R symptoms of alcohol abuse and dependence. Antisocial peer affiliation was measured by self-report of the proportion of one’s friends that exhibited types of antisocial behaviors. Findings: The LBM-SR model revealed that there was a large correlation between the growth factors for alcohol use problems and antisocial peer affiliation (r = .78, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: .76, ,80) and cross-lagged effects consistent with both selection and socialization effects. Additionally, antisocial peer affiliation in adolescence was associated with greater increases in alcohol use problems over time (r = .57, 95% CI: .54, .60). Genetic influences largely accounted for the association between antisocial peer affiliation in pre-adolescence and growth in alcohol use problems, while shared environmental influences accounted for the correlation between antisocial peer affiliation and alcohol use problems growth factors. Conclusions: Antisocial peer affiliation in adolescence appears to be a salient, genetically-influenced risk factor for early alcohol use and increase in alcohol use from adolescence through young adulthood.",2020-10-14T11:57:52.684692+00:00,"co-development,peers,alcohol use,heritability",,,"Sarah Brislin, Matt McGue, Mary Heitzeg, Brian M.

E0057-34B-271,Subgrouping suicidal ideations: An ecological momentary assessment study in psychiatric inpatients,"**Background.** Suicidal ideations (SI) are amongst the strongest predictors for suicide attempts, yet reliable prediction models for suicide risk are still lacking. One challenge is that SI may vary when indexed over time. This could be due to SI subgroups that might hold crucial information for suicide risk prediction. We aimed to expand on prior approaches that averaged across the SI trajectories and instead use an approach that respects the temporal nature of SI. **Methods.** First, we applied longitudinal clustering to ecological momentary assessment SI data (5 assessments/day over 28 days) of 51 psychiatric patients (61% female, mean age = 35.26, *SD* = 12.54). Specifically, we used KmlShape, an algorithm that takes the SI raw scores and measurement occasion index as input. Second, we regressed each subgroup on established clinical SI risk factors (i.e., history of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, hopelessness, diagnosis of depression, diagnosis of anxiety disorder, and history of abuse). **Results.** We identified four subgroups with distinct SI patterns: (1) “Episodic intensity SI” (high mean, high variability), (2) “Consistent low average SI” (lowest mean, lowest variability), (3) “Chronic moderate average SI” (low mean, low variability), and (4) “Intermittent high SI” (highest mean, highest variability). Further, the subgroups were meaningfully associated with clinical characteristics, i.e., the least severe SI subgroup (“Consistent low average SI”) entailed the least hopeless individuals (beta = -0.95, 95% CI = -1.04, -0.86), and the most severe SI subgroup (“Intermittent high SI”) the most hopeless (beta = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.72, 0.95). **Conclusion.** Applying longitudinal clustering to EMA collected from patients with SI allows to identification of valid and reliable SI subgroups with more distinct clinical characteristics, an important step towards a better understanding of SI and a basis for improving prediction and prevention. **Trial Registration.** 10DL12_183251.",2022-06-09T11:49:53.743609+00:00,"latent profile analysis,subgroups,sucidal ideation,phenotypes,longitudinal clustering",,,"Marion Gabi, Anja Ries, Sofia Michel, Zachary Joseph Roman, Tobias Kowatsch, Isaac Galatzer-Levy, Stephanie Homan, Nina Klee, Philipp Homan, Birgit Kleim, Hanne Scherer, Urte Scholz, Michael Colla, Stefan Vetter, Sebastian Olbrich, Carlo Berther, Sarina Blaser, Anna-Marie Bertram, Prabhakaran Santhanam, Erich Seifritz",psyarxiv
E007C-914-872,“I've got no PPE to protect my mind”: Understanding the needs and experiences of first responders exposed to trauma in the workplace,"Background: First responders (FRs) are at high risk of being exposed to traumatic events in their occupational roles. Responding to critical incidents often involves exposure to life-threatening circumstances, dealing with fatalities as well as encountering highly stressful situations that may trigger traumatic responses. These experiences can lead to poor physical and mental health outcomes including post-traumatic stress disorder, co-morbid conditions such as depression, anxiety, substance abuse, insomnia, and suicidality. Little research has explored the perspectives and experiences of FRs in dealing with occupational trauma(s) and how best to meet their health needs. Objective: This study aimed to explore FRs’ experiences of exposure to occupational trauma and its impact on their mental wellbeing. The wider objective was to investigate how FRs can be supported to access appropriate and relevant help, addressing barriers like stigma. Method: A qualitative research design using in-depth semi-structured interviews with FRs (n = 54) was adopted. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed using an inductive thematic approach. Results: Themes developed were: (1) The pervasive, cumulative and salient impact of occupational trauma on mental health (micro-traumas, nightmares, flashbacks and reliving experiences), (2) The demands of the job exacerbating the adverse effects of trauma (self and others), (3) Insufficient support and unhelpful ways of coping following exposure to trauma (lack of psychological safety), (4) Stigma and fear of judgement as barriers to mental health help-seeking, and (5) Need for specific, accessible and credible trauma-focused interventions and workplace support. Conclusions: The implications of these findings are discussed at the individual, service provider and organisational level, emphasising the importance of implementing a strengths-based, non-pathologising and de-stigmatising approach to trauma in the workplace as experienced by FRs. Emphasis is placed on the importance of overcoming barriers to accessing mental health support and improving access to evidence-based, trauma-focused psychological interventions and workplace support.",2024-05-29T13:43:02.599777+00:00,"workplace stress,first responder,psychotraumatology,trauma,healthcare worker,help-seeking,qualitative",,,"Tara Burns, Wiktoria Ptak, Lucy Milligan, Nicola Cogan, Christoph Graf Rodriguez, Hannes De Kock, Robyn McCluskey, Ashleigh Craig, Alison Kirk",psyarxiv
E0124-0D5-E57,Adverse Childhood Experiences and Adult Psychopathology: A Latent Class Analysis Approach,"Background: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are linked to poor mental health outcomes, yet existing research often oversimplifies ACE impacts by focusing on cumulative risk rather than distinct types of adversity. This limits insights into how specific ACE patterns influence psychopathology. Inquiries into links between ACE exposure and mental health typically focus on a single symptom class, overlooking co-occurring psychopathologies.
Objective: We used latent class analysis (LCA) to identify distinct patterns of ACE exposure and examine associations with anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in a treatment-seeking adult sample.
Participants and Setting: Participants were 514 adults (71% female) aged 18-85 (M=26.25, SD=8.68) seeking psychological treatment. Data were collected at a public clinic using validated self-report measures.
Methods: LCA identified three classes of ACE exposure: low adversity, maltreatment (emotional/physical abuse and neglect), and household dysfunction (parental mental illness, separation). Psychopathology symptoms were assessed using the DASS-21, PCL-5, and ASRS. Associations between ACE classes and psychopathologies were analyzed using BCH-adjusted models controlling for comorbidities.
Results: The maltreatment class showed significantly higher depression (B = 3.02, p &lt; .001) and PTSD symptoms (B=11.65, p&lt;.001) than the low adversity class. The household dysfunction class exhibited elevated ADHD symptoms (B=12.09, p&lt;.001) compared to both maltreatment and low adversity classes. No significant differences in anxiety were observed after controlling for comorbidities.
Conclusions: Distinct ACE patterns were linked to specific psychopathology symptoms. Findings highlight the need to move beyond cumulative models to person-centered approaches, which can inform targeted prevention and treatment strategies.",2025-07-10,"adverse childhood experiences;,household dysfunction,latent class analysis,maltreatment,psychopathology",,,"Sarah Tashjian, George Mildred-Short",psyarxiv
E00A7-8AD-59A,Relationships and Resilience in Young adults from Fragmented and Discordant Households in India,"India witnesses high rates of intimate partner violence [37.7% incidence in the South East Asia zone per WHO data, 2012]. Taboos about marital separation and divorce exist across socioeconomic strata, meaning, a large number of Indian children grow up in discordant households witness chronic abuse of one or both parents. Another belief that binds many discordant partners is that separation or divorce leads to poor mental health and personality outcomes in progenies, long term. On the contrary, prior studies in Western samples have shown that there are significant negative outcomes for individuals vicariously exposed early childhood adversity including a discordant or violent household. The objective of this study was to assess whether resilience, a key personality attribute, differs among college-aged individuals who grew up in traditional two-parent households without conflict, a discordant household or a single parent household. 116 participants aged 18-24 (M=20.3 SD= 1.2, 86F) were recruited at Ashoka University. Resilience scores were calculated using The Resilience Scale. A two-way ANOVA examining the effect of family structure and gender on resilience score showed that family structure but not gender has a direct effect on resilience scores [ F (2, 116) = 3.122 p=0.048] but the effect is barely significant. Post hoc (Bonferroni) testing indicated that individuals from single-parent households (M=136, SD=19.01) or discordant households (M=134, SD= 17.81, p=0.50) tended to score higher on resilience than individuals from two-parent, non-conflicted families (M=121.05, SD= 20.53, p=0.066). Contrary to popular belief, results suggest that growing up in traditional two-parent households do not offer any significant advantage over single-parent households as far as resilience is concerned. These results provide initial evidence against existing social taboos and can be expanded upon for further cross-cultural validation. Further, a qualitative study explores the experiences of relationships of young adults from the three family types.",2019-10-28T22:50:13.725727+00:00,"young adults,resilience,family sturcture,india,single parents,relationships,intimate partner violence",,,Aayushi,psyarxiv
E0045-A8B-475,Machine learning of language use on Twitter reveals weak and non-specific predictions,"Background: Depressed individuals use language differently than healthy controls and it has been proposed that social media posts could therefore be used to identify depression. But much of the evidence behind this claim relies on indirect measures of mental health that are sometimes circular, such as statements of self-diagnosis (“Got an OCD diagnosis today”) on social media or membership in disorder-specific online forums. Relatedly, few studies have tested if these language features are specific to depression versus other aspects of mental health. Methods: We analyzed the Tweets of 1,006 participants who completed questionnaires assessing symptoms of depression and 8 other mental health conditions. Daily Tweets were subjected to textual analysis and the resulting linguistic features were used to train an Elastic Net model on depression severity, using nested cross validation. We then tested performance in a held-out test set (30%), comparing predictions of depression versus 8 other aspects of mental health. Results: The depression trained model had only modest predictive performance when tested out of sample, explaining just 2.5% of variance in depression symptoms (R2 = 0.025, r = 0.16). The performance of this model was as-good or superior when used to identify other aspects of mental health: schizotypy (R2 = 0.035, r = 0.19), social anxiety (R2 = 0.025, r = 0.16), eating disorders (R2 = 0.011, r = 0.12), generalized anxiety (R2 = 0.041, r = 0.21), above chance for obsessive-compulsive disorder (R2 = 0.011, r = 0.12), apathy (R2 = 0.008, r = 0.11), but not significant for alcohol abuse (R2 = -0.012, r = 0.04) or impulsivity (R2 = -0.001, r = 0.08). Conclusions: Machine learning analysis of social media data, when trained on well-validated clinical instruments, could not make meaningful individualized out-of-sample predictions regarding mental health status of users. For the small effects observed, language use associated with depression was non-specific, having similar performance in predicting other mental health problems.",2021-03-23T10:11:22.433700+00:00,"mental health,social media,machine learning,depression",,,"Claire Gillan, Sean Kelley, Caoimhe Ní Mhaonaigh, Louise Burke, Robert Whelan",psyarxiv
E0205-37C-BB4,"Childhood adversity and psychopathology: the dimensions of timing, type and chronicity in a population-based sample of high-risk adolescents","Background – Research on childhood adversity and psychopathology has begun investigating the dimension of timing, however the results have been contradicting depending on the study population, outcome and how adverse life events (ALEs) were operationalized. Additionally, studies so far typically focus only on a narrow range of psychiatric diagnoses or symptoms. Aims – To examine the association between timing, type and chronicity of ALEs and adolescent mental health problems. Methods – Adolescents from a population based cohort oversampled on emotional and behavioral problems (mean age 14.8; range 12-17, N=861) were included in the current analysis. Primary caregivers were interviewed on what ALEs adolescents experienced. ALEs were defined in two ways: 1) broad operationalization, including school difficulties, parental divorce, and family sickness; and 2) physically threatening abuse only, including physical and sexual violence. After looking at lifetime ALEs, we turned to chronicity, timing and sex differences. We focused on overall psychiatric symptoms as well as specific domains of emotional and behavioral problems, assessed using the Youth Self Report (YSR) and psychotic experiences assessed using the Prodromal Questionnaire-16 (PQ-16). A series of linear models adjusted for sociodemographic and parental factors were used. Results – Lifetime ALEs were associated with all types of psychopathology, with relatively bigger effect sizes for broad than for physical ALEs. The latter associations were found to be more robust to unmeasured confounding. The 9-12 age period of experiencing both broad and physical ALE’s was most saliently associated with any psychopathology. Girls were more at risk after experiencing any ALEs, especially if the adversity was chronic or ALEs took place after the age of 12. Conclusions – Broad as well as physical ALEs are associated with psychopathology, especially ALEs experienced during the 9-12 age period. Physical ALEs may be more useful in investigating specific etiological factors then broad ALEs. Sex differences may not emerge in lifetime measures of ALEs, but can be important for chronic and later childhood adversity.",2023-12-04T16:12:12.941386+00:00,,,,"Cornelis Mulder, Milan Zarchev, Witte J.G.

E01A6-DE3-86E,"A meta-analysis on the relation between acute stress exposure, alcohol consumption and cortisol levels in individuals with a personal, familial or no alcohol use disorder","Aims: To investigate the relation between acute stress exposure, acute alcohol consumption, and corti-sol levels among individuals with varying statuses of alcohol use disorder (AUD) and family histories of AUD.
Design: We conducted a systematic search for primary studies registered in the PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, and PsycInfo databases up to July 31, 2023, providing data on the volume of alcohol consumed in millilitre after stress compared to control procedures, or on the effect of acute alcohol consumption, with or without simultaneous stress exposure, on minimal (CMin indicating cortisol recovery) and differ-ences between minimal and maximal cortisol levels (CMaxMin indicating cortisol reactivity). The samples’ AUD status was categorized as actively drinking individuals meeting AUD criteria (including abuse and dependence; AUD+), abstinent individuals who previously met the criteria, or individuals with no AUD di-agnosis. The samples’ family history of AUD status was extracted or approximated on lifetime prevalence rates of AUD for the respective country or cultural area. 
Findings: We integrated data from 53 experimental and 31 observational studies. Our meta-analysis suggests that acute stress exposure increases alcohol consumption only when small study effects are not accounted for (gREE=0.25 vs. gPEESE= 0.02; CI95% = -0.19-0.23). Acute alcohol consumption decreases corti-sol recovery (CMin↑; gREE= 0.15; CI95%= -0.02-0.31), particularly in actively drinking individuals with AUD+ (gREE= 0.46; CI95%= 0.03-0.90) and those with a familial history of AUD (gREE= 0.16; CI95%= -0.08-0.39). Acute alcohol consumption does not significantly alter cortisol reactivity (β= -0.01; CI95%= -0.14-0.12), with divergent effects observed in individuals with AUD+ (CMaxMin↑) or familial AUD history (CMaxMin↓).
Conclusions: The evidence presented suggests that acute stress does not substantially increase alcohol consumption, and that alcohol consumption does not effectively regulate reactive cortisol stress re-sponses. Minimal cortisol levels may be more suitable indicators for detecting alcohol-related changes in the cortisol stress processing system.",2025-04-10,"AUD,alcohol,cortisol reactivity,cortisol recovery,stress",,,"Robert Miller, Tanja Endrass, Lisa Weckesser, Maximilian Pilhatsch, Markus Muehlhan (Mühlhan)",psyarxiv
E008F-33C-A20,The DECRYPT trial: Study protocol for a phase II randomised controlled trial of cognitive therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in youth exposed to multiple traumatic stressors.,"Background: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a distressing and disabling condition that affects significant numbers of children and adolescents. Youth exposed to multiple traumas (e.g. abuse, domestic violence) are at particular risk of developing PTSD. Cognitive-Therapy for PTSD (CT-PTSD), derived from adult work, is a theoretically-informed, disorder-specific form of trauma-focused cognitive-behavioural therapy (TF-CBT). While efficacious for child and adolescent single-event trauma samples, its effectiveness in routine settings with more complex, multiple-trauma exposed youth has not been established. The Delivery of Cognitive Therapy for Young People after Trauma (DECRYPT) randomised controlled trial (RCT) examines the effectiveness of CT-PTSD for treating PTSD following multiple trauma exposure in children and young people in comparison to treatment as usual (TAU). Methods/Design: This protocol describes a two-arm, patient-level, single blind, superiority RCT comparing CT-PTSD (n=60) to TAU (n=60) in children and young people aged 8-17 years with a diagnosis of PTSD following multiple trauma exposure. The primary outcome is PTSD severity assessed using the Children’s Revised Impact of Event Scale (8-item version) at post-treatment (i.e. approximately five months post-randomisation). Secondary outcomes include structured interview assessment for PTSD, complex PTSD symptoms, depression and anxiety, overall functioning and parent-rated mental health. Mid-treatment and 11- and 29-month post-randomisation assessments will also be completed. Process-outcome evaluation will consider which mechanisms underpin or moderate recovery. Qualitative interviews with the young people, their families and their therapists will be undertaken. Cost-effectiveness of CT-PTSD relative to TAU will be also be assessed. Ethics and dissemination: This trial protocol has been approved by a UK Health Research Authority (HRA) Research Ethics Committee (East of England – Cambridge South, 16/EE/0233). Findings will be disseminated broadly via peer-reviewed empirical journal articles, conference presentations, and clinical workshops. Trial registration: ISRCTN, ISRCTN12077707.

E015A-980-EFE,Biological Aging in Maltreated Children Followed up into Middle Adulthood,"Importance: Childhood adversity has been linked to many indicators of shorter healthy lifespan, including earlier onset of disease and disability as well as early mortality. These observations suggest the hypothesis that childhood maltreatment may accelerate aging. We tested this hypothesis in a prospective cohort of individuals with documented childhood maltreatment and controls matched on demographic and socioeconomic factors. Objective: To characterize the relationship between childhood maltreatment and accelerated biological aging in a prospective cohort of documented cases of childhood maltreatment and matched controls. Design: Prospective cohort study Setting: Cases were drawn from juvenile and adult court records from the years 1967 through 1971 in a large Midwest metropolitan geographic area. Controls were selected from the same schools and hospitals of birth and matched on age, sex, race, and approximate socioeconomic status. Participants: 357 individuals with documented cases of childhood maltreatment and 250 matched controls Exposure: Court-substantiated cases of childhood physical or sexual abuse, or neglect occurring at age 11 or younger Outcome: Biological aging quantified using two blood-chemistry algorithms, the Klemera-Doubal method Biological Age (KDM BA) and the PhenoAge, developed and validated in data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) using published methods and publicly available software. Results: Participants (55% women, 49% non-White) had mean age of 41 years (SD=4). Those with court substantiated childhood maltreatment history exhibited more advanced biological aging as compared with matched controls, although this difference was statistically different for only the KDM BA measure (KDM BA Cohen’s D=0.20, 95% CI=[0.03,0.36], p=0.02; PhenoAge Cohen’s D=0.09 95% CI=[-0.08,0.25], p=0.296). In subgroup analyses, maltreatment effect sizes were larger for women as compared to men and for White participants as compared to non-White participants, although these differences were not statistically significant at the α=0.05 level. Conclusions and Relevance: As of midlife, effects of childhood maltreatment on biological aging are small in magnitude but discernible. Interventions to treat psychological and behavioral sequelae of exposure to childhood maltreatment, including in midlife adults, have potential to protect survivors from excess burden of disease, disability, and mortality in later life.",2022-03-17T21:56:07.114030+00:00,,,,"Dayoon Kwon, Xuechen Li, Gloria Huei-Jong Graf, Cathy Spatz Widom, Daniel Belsky",psyarxiv
E0177-B2E-3D3,Longitudinal effects of poverty on men’s perpetration of partner violence in South Africa,"Introduction: Although poverty is often viewed as a driver of intimate partner violence (IPV), few studies have examined how changes in poverty influence men’s IPV perpetration over time. One sensitive marker of poverty is food security, or the ability of households to obtain adequate nutrition. The influence of food security has been associated with IPV in cross-sectional studies, but here we examine whether a causal relationship exists. Methods: We followed a cohort of 2,479 men living in a peri-urban settlement near Johannesburg, South Africa during the period of February 2016-August 2018. Using self-completed audio-assisted questionnaires, men responded at baseline (T0), 12 months later (T1), and 24 months later (T2). Questions about current food security, household type, childhood conditions, and past-year IPV perpetration were asked. We used cross-lagged dynamic panel modeling to assess whether food insecurity changes influenced men’s IPV perpetration over time. Results: A large proportion of men (46.9%) reported perpetrating IPV at baseline, but this proportion reduced over time (39.2% and 26.5% reported IPV at midline and endline, respectively). Less than half (41.4%) of participants reported food insecurity at T0, and this stayed consistent at T1 and T2. In cross-sectional bivariate analysis, food insecurity was higher among those men perpetrating IPV than among those who used no violence at all three time-points. In a cross-lagged dynamic panel model, food insecurity predicted men’s use of IPV one year later. Food insecurity was associated with a small, but significant, longitudinal impact on men’s IPV use (standardized coefficient=0.08, p=0.035) and the model fit indices were strong (RMSEA=0.027, CFI=0.993). This longitudinal association between food insecurity and IPV perpetration persisted in a final model controlling for housing status, age at baseline, and childhood exposure to abuse (coef=0.10, p=0.022) that had strong fit (RMSEA=0.015, CFI=0.998). In a separate model, IPV perpetration did not predict later food security, suggesting a causal relationship from poverty to IPV perpetration. Conclusions: Food insecurity and housing, as distinct markers of poverty, had small but persistent longitudinal effects on men’s perpetration of IPV in a peri-urban settlement in South Africa. Addressing IPV perpetration will require examination of broader structural challenges, such as livelihoods and food security, particularly in settings with endemic poverty. Future interventions should consider livelihood strategies to improve health outcomes for both women and men.",2020-04-02T11:21:48.606210+00:00,"structural equation modeling,longitudinal analysis,poverty,food security,intimate partner violence",,,"Dumisani Rebombo, Abigail Hatcher, Sheri Weiser, Torsten Neilands, Nicola Christofides",psyarxiv
E011E-147-E97,"Ethnonational Historical Narratives in Works of Serbian, Croatian and Bosniak Academics: Case Study","The dissolution of Yugoslavia is an example of how radical transformation of the past could be intertwined with violent conflict, which led to mass destruction and atrocities in the Western Balkan region, leaving consequences even today. Scholars, especially the ones who are members of prestigious national academies, should enlighten the political abuse of history as it contrasts scientific rigour. However, circumstances of war and rising tensions influence every member of society, including social scientists. Therefore, our aim was to investigate the implications for intergroup relations of ""new"" ethnonational narratives in the scientific works of Serbian, Croatian and Bosniak members of national academies. In this case study, we used qualitative content analysis of three books (one for each ethnic group), which were selected due to their relevance for the history of relations between three ethnic groups and representativity for ethnonational narratives. The analytical framework was based on Bar-Tal's (2007) theory about socio-psychological foundations of conflict which assumes a specific organization of collective memory developed during the war that poses an obstacle to reconciliation after an official peace agreement. Thus, the codes used were: 1) justness of in-group goals (in-group goals and ways of attaining them in the past are justified and claimed existential, while out-group goals are rejected and criticized); 2) delegitimization of out-group (emphasis is placed on historical representations which depict out-groups as negative and inhuman, including their traits, intentions and deeds); 3) victimization of in-group (in-group is depicted as a historical victim of rival out-groups with emphasis on strong and exaggerated depictions of killings, oppression, destruction); 4) positive in-group image (the exclusive emphasis is on the historical representations of exaggerated in-group positive traits, intentions and deeds). Results showed that four themes of socio-psychological 'infrastructure' of conflict are present in the selected academic works. Among all authors, the justness of in-group goals and delegitimization of the out-group dominate the text. On the other hand, examples of critical analysis of the in-group and its goals, as well as examples of the positive image of the ethnic out-groups and acknowledging their victims are almost absent. In rare cases when such themes are mentioned, it is with a function to discredit and relativize them. Hence, the case study shows how ethnonational narratives, even in works of academics from different ethnic groups, could contribute to creating and maintaining the socio-psychological infrastructure of conflict. We discuss the responsibility of social scientists, national scientific institutions and guidelines for liberating historical science from political manipulation.",2023-08-01T15:07:52.952351+00:00,"dissolution of yugoslavia,history,historical narratives,collective memory,intergroup relations,reconciliation,national academies",,,Jovan Ivanović,psyarxiv
E023E-FBE-9CF,A survey of United Kingdom (UK) Bisexuals' experiences of emotional distress support,"As a psychotherapist and bisexual I was concerned after reading studies showing bisexuals have worse wellbeing than others and hearing multiple anecdotes from bisexuals about poor support from mental health or counselling services. I organised a number of gatherings to collect UK bisexuals' experiences of emotional distress support and clustered the results. Participants wanted good therapeutic experiences and sometimes found tolerant therapists who would be with them on a sometimes confusing or distressing journey of self-understanding and acceptance. Some valued therapists who were able to work with people who could not label their sexuality. Some experiences with Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Trans (LGBT) services or therapists were positive, others were not. Bisexual clients may see multiple services over multiple episodes prompting confidentiality concerns, inappropriate psychiatric referrals, fatigue from needing to explain our sexuality multiple times and a lottery of whether a supplied therapist will be bi-friendly. Many participants had their bisexuality treated as pathological, as a symptom of underlying pathology or as the cause of their problems. Therapists seemed overly fixated on looking for a cause for a client's bisexuality. Therapist ignorance was often mentioned: Disclosing that they had never worked with a bi person, using an overly simplistic coming out model from straight to gay, being unaware of biphobia as a source of stress and incorrectly assuming all LGBT groups would welcome bisexuals. Many bisexuals reported therapists focussing on sexuality rather than the client's chosen area of concern, sometimes showing excessive interest in a client's sexual activity. Alternatively, some therapists avoided the issue. Some challenged a client to justify or prove their bisexuality in ways that clients thought would not have happened for lesbian, gay or heterosexual clients. Some reported experiences were gendered and/or sexist with women / women relationships being treated less seriously, bisexuality sometimes being seen as a defense and assumptions that all abuse was of women by men. Some respondents raised important intersectional issues around madness, race, class, religion, age and political climate. Some participants were also in education to provide emotional support professionally and reported a lack of course and tutor time, knowledge and interest on sexuality in general and challenges in being openly bi as a learner. While being aware of psychological dynamics affecting reports of therapy, a number of issues were commonly reported and I recommend should be addressed: Bisexuality is not an illness or logically connected with pathology. Bisexual clients should be listened to carefully and therapists should educate themselves outside of the clinic about the complexity and diversity of human sexuality. Therapists should process their own confusion or assumptions around sexuality in order to be in the right place to accompany clients on their journeys. More bisexual visibility is likely to be helpful.",2019-11-05T12:22:18.096240+00:00,"community research,survey,emotional distress,lgbt,bisexuality,psychotherapy,counselling,counselling psychology,mental health,bisexual",,,Grant Denkinson,psyarxiv
E00EC-5DD-CCE,Parenting in a Pandemic: Parental Stress During the Physical Distancing Intervention Following the onset of the COVID-19 Outbreak,"Objective: The main aim of the study was to examine levels of parental stress and symptoms of depression and anxiety in the general parental population (N = 2868) during the strict government-initiated physical distancing protocols following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We further investigated specific predictors of parental distress, including burnout, anger aimed at children, worry, lack of social support, lower perceived self-efficacy, and difficulty to work from home. Method: In this cross-sectional, epidemiological study, we disseminate an online survey that was administered two weeks after the government-initiated physical distancing protocols were established. Data were collected from March 31 to April 7. Results: Female parents compared to male parents and parents living with more than one child per parent or child(ren) with special needs compared to those living with one or fewer children per parent reported higher levels of parental stress. Burnout and social support were further associated with parental stress. Specifically, nearly one-fourth of the parents reported that they have felt burned out or in the proximity of feeling burned out more than half the days during the social distancing interventions. Also, 29% of the parents reported that they were angrier at their child(ren) than usual during the physical distancing period. Parents with a pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis had significantly higher parental stress compared to individuals with no psychiatric diagnosis. The reported prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms above standardized cutoff levels among the 2868 parents was 25.4% for depression and 24.1% for anxiety, with the highest prevalence score on both symptoms of anxiety (37.6%) and depression (38.5%) for the youngest parents (age group 21–30 years). Furthermore, the parents who were home with their children and predominantly followed distancing protocol by socially distancing from public activity and peers (i.e., at least 10 out of 14 days) had significantly higher symptoms of depression (29%) and anxiety (27%), compared to parents who did not isolate in the same manner (i.e., depression 13% and anxiety 15%). Conclusions: The present study reveals that home confinement during the restricted lockdown period is related to markedly high levels of parental stress, in addition to symptoms of depression and anxiety in parents. Given the detrimental effects of depression, anxiety, and parental stress on the quality of life, morbidity rates, as well as adverse child outcomes and the potential risk of child abuse and neglect, these results suggest that appropriate action should be taken to impede further development of these symptoms, as well as developing interventions aimed at vulnerable subgroups and other relevant factors associated with increased parental stress.

E01C6-99A-620,Responses to Belief-Conflicting Information: Justification of Support for Donald Trump,"Two studies take a dissonance theory perspective to understanding why individuals support Donald Trump as president of the United States despite accusations that he has engaged in sexual misconduct and illegal activity. Participants were randomly assigned to a dissonance condition in which they read an essay about Trump’s sexual misconduct or a neutral essay. They provided open-ended responses to 2 questions that asked why participants support Trump and how they justify their support given allegations against him. These responses were coded by a judge who was blind to condition. Study 1 was conducted 2 months before Trump was impeached. In this study, 7 categories of reasons for supporting Trump, and 3 categories of justification despite allegations, were identified. A comparison of conditions showed that participants in the dissonance condition were more likely to state that they disbelieved the accusations and less likely to state that Trump’s policies matter and not his personal life. Study 2 was conducted 2 days after the vote to impeach Trump, when high dissonance would be expected for all Trump supporters. Results replicated the categories of support and justification from Study 1, plus additional categories. A quasi-experimental comparison of These studies take a dissonance theory perspective to understanding why individuals support Donald Trump as president of the United States despite accusations that he has engaged in sexual misconduct and illegal activity. Participants provided open-ended responses to questions that asked why they support Trump and how they justify their support given the allegations against him. Study 1 was conducted 2 months before Trump was impeached for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. In this study, 7 categories of reasons for supporting Trump, and 3 categories of 22 justification despite allegations, were identified. Study 2 was conducted 2 days after a vote to impeach Trump. Study 3 was conducted 2 days after Trump was arraigned for his involvement in the Jan 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol Building. Results from Studies 2 and 3 replicated the categories of support and justification. Across studies, the reasons given to justify support of Trump despite allegations of wrongdoing were stating that they disbelieved the allegation, claiming that others do similar misdeeds, and stating that they care about his policies, not his personal life. A comparison of the 3 studies revealed that participants in Study 3 were more likely to justify their support for Trump by saying they disbelieved the allegations, and less likely to say that others do similar misdeeds or that they care about policies, compared to those in Studies 1 and 2. The current results suggest that individuals in a naturalistic context may choose a number of different strategies in response to information that conflicts with their important beliefs, including denying the veracity of information, increasing the importance of consonant information, and directing attention to the immoral acts of others. These results are unlike those of most laboratory research on dissonance theory, in which participants are given only one dissonance reduction opportunity.",2020-10-01T05:37:39.081207+00:00,"defensive processing,cognitive dissonance,self-justification,motivated reasoning",,,"Eddie Harmon-Jones, Thomas F Denson, Robin Willardt, Cindy Harmon-Jones",psyarxiv
E005A-FFE-3D8,"Macaques as Members of a Human Family: Novel and Undocumented Behavioral Insights into Human-Macaque Bonds and the Case of Kaka, Mit, and Puka as Victims of Selective Legal Enforcement Rooted in Generalized Prejudices","Macaques, commonly classified as wild animals, are often excluded from consideration as companion animals due to prevailing prejudices and institutional frameworks. However, newly emerging observations reveal that some individuals have formed deep, reciprocal emotional bonds with macaques, integrating them, not merely as pets, but as genuine members of the family. This lifestyle appears to bring greater psychological, intellectual and social fulfillment for the macaques, surpassing the well-being of their wild and captive counterparts, thus contributing to the emergence or more evolved profiles. These cases challenge the dominant long-standing paradigm that macaques “cannot be pets” or “belong only in the wild”, and other prejudices, rooted in earlier observations of captive macaques suffering neglect, abuse, and psychological distress, observations which have shaped current legal and ethical assumptions. They highlight a quiet revolution in human-primate relationships, rooted in mutual understanding and fulfillment, deep emotional reciprocity, and enrichment, and argue for distinguishing macaques integrated into families from the conventional notion of “captivity” which fails to reflect their lived experience.
Despite growing evidence of healthy, enriched, and mutually fulfilling human-primate relationships, many regulatory bodies, continue to operate under outdated non-inclusive convictions, instead of exhibiting scientific curiosity and ethical reflection. As a result, they would intervene, using rigid interpretations of wildlife law to confiscate well-cared-for macaques, sometimes selectively and without conducting any behavioral or welfare assessments, disrupting the lives of well-adjusted macaques and causing trauma, regression, and even fatal outcomes, to which they nonetheless remain indifferent and unaccountable. 
This paper examines the ethical and scientific shortcomings of rigid legal applications and critiques how institutional bias and the unchecked enforcement, particularly through the story of the monkeys Kaka, Mit and Puka, can become a mechanism of harm in the name of conservation and in the name of the law, no longer serving an intent to protect, but an intent to punish, deriving the law from its original purpose. This is especially problematic when authority is delegated to NGOs or agencies driven by personal or political agendas rather than genuine concern for animal welfare. It highlights the urgent need to distinguish between signs of fulfillment and distress, and advocates for policy reform that incorporates these behavioral indicators into law enforcement procedures, as the consequences of confiscation differ dramatically between abused and emotionally bonded, well-cared-for macaques.
Ultimately, this review not only challenges assumptions about macaques in human families, but calls for making ethics a legal duty to protect animals from being victimized by punitive or corrupt enforcement practices; It argues for a more nuanced, case-by-case approach, individualized welfare assessments rooted in international animal welfare principles that prioritize emotional bonds and quality of life over rigid legal classification, by integrating behavioral science and ethical analysis into legal processes to uphold the original protective intent of the law over political interests or vengeful action; And it encourages transparency and the recognition that not all human-primate relationships are harmful, some are profoundly beneficial to the animals.",2025-06-30,Macaque behavior; fulfillment spectrum; Interspecies relationships; Human-macaque bond; Human-animal bond; Macaques integrated as members of a human family; captive macaques; wild macaques; Emotional needs; Wildlife conservation; Animal welfare; laws; Law enforcement; Misuse of the law; Conservation ethics; Wildlife; Domestic; Policies; Animal rights; Kaka and Mit; Puka; Rafus,,,Elige Chbat,psyarxiv
E01CF-7FE-842,Social and Neurobiological Mechanisms of Risk and Resilience in Young People: The Longitudinal THRIVE-study,"More than half of the children and adolescents worldwide experience at least one form of childhood adversity (e.g., abuse, neglect or bullying) whilst growing up. Childhood adversity is among the strongest predictors of mental health problems in adolescence and adulthood. Yet, some individuals show resilient functioning, meaning they have good mental health and well-being despite their exposure to childhood adversity. Childhood adversity is thought to affect mental health through its impact on neurocognitive functioning, for example through blunted social feedback learning and biased emotion and threat processing. The neurocognitive social transactional model suggests that such childhood adversity related neurocognitive functioning may ultimately lead to reductions in the quality and quantity of social relations and increases in stressful experiences with peers over time, increasing the risk for mental health problems. However, empirical evidence to support this theoretical framework is scarce. Therefore, the longitudinal Towards Health and Resilience in Volatile Environments (THRIVE) study is set out to investigate the dynamics of psychological, social, and neurobiological mechanisms underlying mental health functioning in adolescents aged 18-24 years with a history of childhood adversity.

The ongoing THRIVE study aims to recruit 288 participants aged 18-24 years who retrospectively self-report childhood adversity (current N=220). This longitudinal neuroimaging study consists of 6 sessions including an in-unit session, during which participants undergo extensive testing including salivary cortisol measures, emotion labelling measures, as well as functional neuroimaging (whilst completing the Montreal Imaging Stress Task and the Social Feedback Learning Task). In the longitudinal part of the study, participants fill out online questionnaires at 5 time points (i.e. every three months) to map the dynamics and associations of social support, mental health, and stressful events, over time. Using the data collected at the in-unit session, we aim to test whether childhood adversity is associated with biased emotion processing, blunted feedback learning and enhanced stress responses, while social support may moderate these effects (i.e. ‘social stress buffering’). The longitudinal component of the THRIVE study allows us to test our hypothesis that mental health problems arise because childhood adversity shapes neurocognitive functioning in a way that, over time, reduces social support and increases social stress. By unravelling how social functioning contributes to resilient functioning after childhood adversity, the THRIVE study will aid crucial knowledge and ultimately help intervention and prevention efforts.

The THRIVE study has been approved by The Medical Ethics Committee Leiden - The Hague - Delft (NL80017.058.21) on July 5th, 2022  and has been co-created with the Augeo Youth Task Force (a panel of young adults with childhood adversity, https://www.augeo.nl/jongerentaskforce). The Augeo Youth Task Force is involved in every step of the empirical cycle to make sure the perspective and knowledge of young people with childhood adversity are incorporated. The results of the THRIVE study will be disseminated through preprints, peer-reviewed scientific publications, scientific presentations, media and public outreach.",2025-08-22,"adolescence,childhood adversity,childhood trauma,emotion processing,feedback learning,friendships,longitudinal,mental health,neuroimaging,protocol,resilience,social support,stress",,,"Elizabeth Buimer, Hannah Dorsman, Antoinette Haverhals, Anne-Laura Van Harmelen, Maximilian König, THRIVE consortium, Peter Bos, Pauline Wessels, Geert-Jan Will",psyarxiv
