E01C5-4AA-536,Lanskap Keagamaan Indonesia,"Buku antologi ini hadir untuk memberikan angin baru atas kering dan kakunya penulisan gagasan. Gaya penulisan yang diusung lebih pada esai bebas yang tidak terikat pada tuntutan dan kaidah akademis. Walaupun lepas dari jerat akademis, namun nilai keilmuan tetap dipertahankan. Hal ini karena, seperti ide awal bahwa perlu ada suatu bentuk tulisan yang mengusung ide segar dengan gaya penulisan yang membumi. Buku ini adalah kumpulan dari berbagai artikel yang meliputi tema radikalisme, terorisme dan perdamaian. Beberapa artikel sudah pernah diterbitkan sebelumnya pada website jalandamai.org milik BNPT. Serperti artikel dengan judul “Gagalnya Kontekstualisasi Jiwa Kepahlawanan oleh Generasi Muda”, “Ketika Teroris Menjadi Pahlawan”, Berita Hoax dan Kemunculan Unsecured Society”, “Bebaskan Generasi Muda dari Belenggu Hoax”, dan “Berita Palsu, Senjata Berbahaya Abad Ini”. Selebihnya adalah artikel-artikel yang belum pernah diterbitkan sebelumnya. Buku ini disusun untuk memberikan pandangan atas perlunya melakukan refleksi dan memikirkan kembali apa yang telah diyakini sebagai sesuatu yang benar. Refleksi dan mempertanyakan kembali adalah ruh dari sikap kritis, dan ini adalah sikap yang akan menuntun kita keluar dari rimba disrupsi dan banjir informasi. Jika hanya membaca namun tak diiringi dengan sikap kritis, maka tak akan ada kebaikan yang dihasilkan. Terutama di era internet seperti saat ini, sharing tanpa saring tak hanya berakibat pada munculnya rangkaian disinformasi-missinformasi-malinformasi, tetapi juga online abuse; dan kita sedang menyaksikan ini terjadi saat ini. Belantara data tanpa pemikiran kritis adalah tanda tanpa makna. Jika hasil dari kemajuan teknologi adalah penerimaan dan kehampaan, maka pekik sapere aude dari era aufklarung perlu dipanggil kembali.",2020-12-17T11:58:57.224110+00:00,"indonesia,keagamaan",,,Wiwit Kurniawan,thesiscommons
E01EF-392-027,Use of the Generalized Bandwidth Allocation Model (G-BAM) for Compliance with Network Neutrality – Proposal and Evaluation,"The flow of data across the Internet has grown considerably in the last years and maintains this trend in volume, complexity, and variety, and therefore needs to be adequately managed by ISPs. Network neutrality represents the concept that ISPs should not discriminate against internet traffic in general based on its source, destination, and content. Several countries adopt a hard stance and prohibit certain abusive conduct from achieving this goal. An open issue and challenging task are to propose an operational and effective traffic management model that can implement and comply with network neutrality on ISP's networks. This dissertation presents evidence on the use of Bandwidth Allocation Models (BAMs) as a mechanism to implement neutrality in IP/MPLS networks. BAMs, in brief, can allocate resources on-demand and have distinct “behaviors” that can achieve network neutrality. This work introduces the AllocTC-Sharing behavior reproduced by the Generalized Bandwidth Allocation Model (G-BAM). It discusses how this behavior can perform a network operation following network neutrality, even using service differentiation. Finally, it simulates and evaluates the compliance with the established rules, considering a non-discriminatory mapping of applications in different Traffic Classes. The results indicate that the AllocTC-Sharing behavior is appropriate and compatible with the net neutrality rules.",2022-02-06T17:56:51.932731+00:00,"g-bam,reasonable internet traffic management – itm,bam,bandwidth allocation model,generalized bandwidth allocation model,alloctc-sharing,network neutrality",,,"Joberto S.

E015D-393-4C9,The Effects of Expressive Interactive Journaling on Word Fluency in Seventh-Grade English Language Arts Students,"Background: Trauma and its effects on affected individuals’ overall health and outcomes have been widely examined and documented by clinicians for decades. From increased incidences of anxiety and depression to chronic health disorders, trauma impacts every aspect of an individual’s functional, social, and emotional capacities. Findings of the most extensive study of childhood trauma resulting from abuse, neglect, and household labeled these instances, along with a host of others, as adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). Prolonged exposure to ACEs through adolescence challenges the child’s sense of safety, stability, bonding, and attachment. Further, severe numerable instances of traumatic experiences in childhood are associated with poorer cognitive performance and lower reading levels due, in part, to low word fluency. As the cornerstone for reading, students with low word fluency struggle to understand grade-level texts, routinely demonstrate poor performance on state Reading assessments and navigate social and emotional situations. As a result, these students are among the highest number of discipline referrals in schools. Schools must develop interventions to mitigate the effects of ACEs on academic performance and student behavior management, especially at the middle school level. Purpose: This study aimed to examine the impact of a researcher-created technique called Expressive Interactive Journaling on improving word fluency in seventh-grade English Language Arts students. The central question examined how engagement in Expressive Interactive Journaling paired with Reading Intervention improved the word fluency of a small group of seventh-grade English Language Arts as measured by the Texas Middle School Fluency Assessment (TMSFA). Participants: Inclusion criteria for this study included a sample of seventh-grade English Language Arts and Reading students who were administered the beginning of year (BOY) iteration of the TMSFA. The sampling of student participants comprised seventh- grade students who were administered and did not demonstrate proficiency on the BOY iteration of the TMSFA and were receiving campus-based Reading Intervention. Additionally, the student participants were of low socioeconomic status (SES), reported several ACEs, and had more than three office referrals in the preceding semester. Methods: Data from the student participant’s performance on the BOY iteration of the TMSFA served as the pretest. The premise and process of EIJ were outlined and modeled for student participants by the researcher and Reading Interventionist before intervention implementation. The word lists from the TMSFA were introduced in stages throughout the study, and participants engaged in EIJ sessions along with whole-word fluency instruction provided by the researcher and a middle school Reading Interventionist in structured 45-minute sessions. Data from student performance during and after the study intervention were outlined using descriptive statistics. Results: Findings indicated a positive correlation between the EIJ study intervention and student participant performance on the EOY iteration of the TMSFA. Moreover, data revealed that the use of EIJ served as a tool for participants to employ to mitigate negative outward responses in social and emotional situations and also mitigated office referrals for behavior for all study participants. Limitations and suggestions for future research are outlined within.",2022-06-16T12:59:05.897677+00:00,,,,Nita Thalia,thesiscommons
E00A1-C27-158,Ser du mig? En kvalitativ innehållsanalys av inlägg från Instagram vilka belyser kvinnan med erfarenhet av prostitution och hennes upplevelse av bemötandet i vården,"Abstract Background: Prostitution is a social problem that occurs in all parts of the world. Many women with experience of prostitution turn to health care for some kind of help. Healthcare professionals are important in identifying the woman with experience of prostitution and her needs. As a result, the care staff's attendance is often crucial for further care and assistance. Good interaction is required in the interaction between healthcare professionals and the woman with experience of prostitution Aim: To elucidate how women with experience of prostitution experience the treatment in health care Method: With a qualitative study design, data from selected posts from open accounts on Instagram has been analyzed with qualitative content analysis. Result: The data analysis resulted in four themes: rejected, stigma, anger and good behavior. The results showed that the women's perception of a professional approach varied. Most of the posts described negative experiences of attending to the care staff, although there were also posts by women who experienced a good response. Some women felt that they had received the wrong type of care, which may have led to further trauma. Conclusion: The survey showed that women with experience of prostitution experience poor treatment from healthcare professionals. The women who are in prostitution have a great desire to write and tell about their experiences when it comes to the treatment of the care staff. There are major gaps in knowledge among healthcare professionals regarding the phenomenon of prostitution and how treatment of women who are in prostitution should take place. It would be of interest to further study the knowledge that healthcare personnel need to best respond to women with experience of prostitution",2020-07-05T15:55:59.767323+00:00,"prostitution,sexual abuse,sexual violence,women",,,Lotta Bergman,thesiscommons
E000D-81D-F5A,Investigating the Role of Gender Euphoria as a Protective Factor Against Minority Stress in the Trans* Population: A Research Proposal,"The transgender and gender diverse (trans*) population is disproportionately affected by chronic health conditions, disability, mental illness, substance abuse, self-harm, and suicidality compared to their cisgender (non-trans*) counterparts (Downing &amp; Przedworski, 2018; Lefevor et al., 2019). This is due to exposure to minority stressors that are specific to the trans* experience, such as gender related discrimination, gender dysphoria, and internalized transphobia (Frost &amp; Meyer, 2023). Resilience, or the ability to adapt to challenging circumstances, has long been studied as a protective factor against stress and adversity (Luthar et al., 2000; Meyer, 2015). Gender euphoria refers to the feelings of joy, pleasure, and satisfaction that can occur when a person's experience of gender aligns with their true gender identity, whether psychologically, physically, or socially (Beischel et al., 2022). The proposed mixed-methods cross-sectional study will use quantitative survey data and qualitative interview data to examine whether gender euphoria can act as a protective factor that improves resilience to minority stress in the trans* population, and if so, which type of gender euphoria is most associated with improved resilience.",2025-01-29T13:40:24.945138+00:00,"gender euphoria,transgender,lgbtq,gender affirmation,resilience,minority stress",,,Olivia Tween,thesiscommons
